# Community

## Persons
Phis community is composed of persons which can be either:
- **persons** identified by their names, email and affiliation, that Phis projects and expertiments can refer too
- persons that own a Phis account, and are refered to as **users**

## Access rights

### User account levels of access
`Guest`: a guest (or "simple") user gets access to public data and data accessible to the groups the user belongs to.

`Owner`: on top of the guest user access rights, an owner can create or delete user accounts.
An owner can also create groups and assign users to those groups.
There is generally no more than one or two owner per platform.

### Group restrictions
A given information can be visible to specific groups. A Phis user not belonging to those groups will not be able to view the data linked to them.
The list of concepts that can be assign to groups is:

- experiments
- ...

### Public data
An information assigned to no group is by default set as public. For instance, an experiment not belonging to any group will be viewable to every Phis user, e.g. to every person owning a Pá¸§is account.

### User groups levels of access
`Guest`: members of a guest group can visualize the data linked to this guest group.

`Owner`: in addition to the visualization rights given to guest groups members, owner groups members can modify the data belonging to the group.
