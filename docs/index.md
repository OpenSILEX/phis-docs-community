# OpenSILEX PHIS users documentation

## Background
OpenSILEX PHIS (Phenotyping Hybrid Information System) is developped for high-throughput plant phenotyping in close interaction to plant phenotyping communities.
Phis is part of OpenSILEX collaborative meta-project developped at MISTEA joint research unit (INRA - SupAgro).
More information on OpenSILEX is available at [montpellier.inra.fr](https://www6.montpellier.inra.fr/mistea/Projets/Silex "SILEX Main Page").
The present documentation is a resource material related to the new version of OpenSILEX PHIS.

Phis is organized around three layers : the layer of the data storage (first layer), which the users do not access directly, but using clients (3rd layer) which interact with the data layer through the web services layer (2nd layer).
