# Overview

## Purposes

### For whom is PHIS2 developed ?

### What is PHIS2 for ?

### Which principles is PHIS2 based on ?

Scientific entities are organised as **Object** classes (e.g. plot, block, field).
A Specific Ontology (OWL) formalizes Objects and Events (RDF) and allows to link reference ontologies (SKOS)


## Structural units

### Objects

plot : link toward AGROVOC: smallest unit (one treatment maximum per plot)

block: combination of plots

field :

### Events
