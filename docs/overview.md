replicability and reproducibility

Interoperability between experiments and phenotyping infrastructures :

- semantic interoperability: know how to understand one another.
- syntactic interoperability: know how to transmit an information in a common form.
- technological interoperability: know how to communicate with one another.

## Phis Purposes

### What is PHIS2 for ?

### Which principles is PHIS2 based on ?

Scientific entities are organised as **Object** classes (e.g. plot, block, field).
A Specific Ontology (OWL) formalizes Objects and Events (RDF) and allows to establish links between these Objects and Events to reference ontologies (SKOS).

## Structural units of the information system

### Objects

plot : link toward AGROVOC: smallest unit (one treatment maximum per plot)

block: combination of plots

field :

### Events

## Architecture

PHIS2 Web Services

## First Steps

The most user-friendly way to access Phis is through a browser.

Type in the URL of the Phis instance developped for your Plant Phenotyping facility in the browser.

On the top-right part of the web page stand two language icons, allowing the user to
switch from English (the defautl language) to French.
