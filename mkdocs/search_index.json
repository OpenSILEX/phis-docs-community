            "text": "Experimental Organization\n\n\nScientific frames\n\n\nScientific experiments generate data, which is the focus the present information system.\nHowever, if only the data produced by experiments is stored, and not the complete experimental conditions, i.e. the environmental conditions, infrastructure and supporting equipment or resources used to conduct those experiments, then such archived data would be orphan and therefore non reusable.\n\n\nThe first element of experimental conditions which is stored in Phis is the scientific frames linked to plant phenotyping experiments.\nA scientific frame can be a national infrastructure, a local infrastructure, or an installation (also refered to as \"platform\" or \"facility\"), as defined at \nemphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu\n and at \nagroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/OEPO\n.\n\n\nUsers register scientific frames in Phis in order to later enrich metadata associated to experimental data by establishing a link between this data and given scientific frames.\n\n\nThe complete list of scientific frames registered in a Phis session is available in the \nExperimental organization / Scientific frames\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\n\n\nThe \nAdd document\n button at the top of the each scientific frame information sheet remains orange until a first document has been added, e.g. a flyer describing the infrastructure or an organization chart.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on documents.\n\n\nIt is from this \nScientific frames\n menu that the installation manager can add the template documents for UAV or Phenomobile acquisition sessions.\nHe has to go to the information sheet of the concerned scientific frame. Then he has to click on the \nAdd document\n button and then select the \nDocument type\n \nAcquisitionSessionUAVDocument\n or \nAcquisitionSessionPhenomobileDocument\n depending on which type of template document is created.\nThose template documents will then be accessible from the \nAcquisition session template\n item from the \nInstallations\n menu in the top bar.\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nWhat are projects ?\n\n\nA research project is the higher level of organisation in Phis.\nIt is generally the object of a contract or a grant agreement between the laboratory performing the research activities and funding agencies providing the financial support.\nA project can hold many experiments from various experimental campaigns.\nBesides, several projects can participate to the same experimentation.\n\n\nWhat are project properties ?\n\n\nProjects fact sheets are all public, i.e. visible for every Phis user, including those unrelated to them.\nHowever, experimental data included in a project is also necessarily related to a given experiment.\nThis data is accessible only to users who belong to a group (either owner or guest) authorized to access the experimentation it is related to: access rights are managed by experiment and not by project.\nPlease see the \nRestrictions to a group\n section of this documentation for further details on data access matters.\n\n\nThe complete list of projects is available in the \nExperimental organization / Projects\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nThe projects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter projects by their acronym, their main source of funding, and their start and end dates.\nThere's no need to use the same case as the expected results: a lowercase search returns every results matching the characters, disregarding whether those match are lowercase or uppercase.\nFurther information on a given project is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the projects list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.\n\n\n\n\nA project information sheet displays all this project information stored in Phis : URI, acronyme, objective, start and end dates, contacts linked to the project, a description, etc.\nDocuments (PDF, tables, etc.) can also be linked to a project.\nAt the top of the project information sheet lie three buttons allowing the user to interact with the selected project.\n\n\n\n\nThe project specifics, displayed in the information sheet, can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button.\n\n\nAnother top button is the \nAdd document\n button which remains orange until a first document has been added.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on Phis documents and for learning how to insert them in the information system.\n\n\nThe \nAdd annotation\n button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected project using the \nWeb Annotation Data Model\n (oa).\nSee the \nAnnotation\n section below for further information on annotations within Phis.\n\n\nCreate a project\n\n\nWithin the \nProjects\n menu, one can create a new project with the\n\nCreate Project\n button.\n\n\nTool tips are provided for most fields: they appear on the left hand side when one drags the pointer on those fields.\n\n\n\n\nThe mandatory fields, followed by a red asterisk, are:\n\n\n\n\nacronyme\n\n\nname\n\n\ndate (start / end)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is highly recommended to fill every field. If possible, fields requiring plain text (keywords, description) should be answered to in English.\n\n\nURI\n. The project URI is automatically created using the acronym provided by the user.\nThe URI creation respects the \nw3 recommandations\n.\n\n\nAcronym\n. Short and meaningful, the acronym will be the preferred way to refer to the created project.\nThe acronym provided here is usually the one of the research project.\nA project acronym cannot include spaces.\nOnce the project created, its acronym can no longer be modified.\n\n\nName\n. Full name of the project, it will seldom be refered to but allows a project creator to explicit the acronym. For instance, \nRAPeSeed Oil content anD Yield under low Nitrogen input\n would be an adequate name for the project whose acronym is \nRAPSODYN\n.\n\n\nSubproject Of\n. If the new project is part of an existing project (requisitly known to Phis), one can select the name of the given mother-project within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new project is created.\n\n\nSubproject Type\n. The subproject type can optionnaly be provided. It can be either an existing type to be selected from the list of proposed project types, either a new type provided by the user. In the later case, one has to type the new subproject type (e.g. \nphd thesis\n or \ninternship\n) in the search field of \nSubproject Type\n and then click on the newly proposed type.\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n. A short synthesis of the project objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the \nDescription\n field.\n\n\nFinancial Support\n. Organism, institution or funding agency providing the financial support of the research project. Only one organism supporting financially the project can be cited for now. Same as the \nSubproject Type\n field, the answer can be both from a predefined list or a new one (the user has to type the new organism name and then click on the search result matching the organism name).\n\n\nFinancial Name\n. As indicated in the tool tip, this field is meant for the user to provide the identification of the financial support document (e.g. a grant agreement number).\n\n\nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n are to be provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day), directly or through the calendar view.\nIf the end date of the project is unknown, the start date can be used also as \nDate End\n temporarily.\n\n\nScientific Contacts\n. Email adresses of the scientists involved in the project.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\nIf unavailable in the predefined list, emails can be added to Phis from the \nPersons\n menu, prior to the new project creation. Please see the \nPersons\n section of this documentation for further details.\n\n\nAdministrative Contacts\n. Email adresses of the administrative personnel linked to the project (e.g. human ressources people).\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nProject Coordinators\n. Email adresses of the project coordinators.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nWebsite\n. If available, URL of the website of the project.\n\n\nKeywords\n. Keywords, preferably in English, characterizing the project. Each keyword should be separated by a comma and not include any capital letter, e.g. \ndrought, maize\n.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n. Complete plain text description of the project, preferably provided in English language. Additionally to the description, additional information can be provided as uploaded files, after the project has been created.\n\n\nExperiments\n\n\nWhat are experiments ?\n\n\nField plant phenotyping experimentations are refered to in Phis as \nExperiments\n.\nExperiments in Phis form self-sustained organizational units occuring in a delimited and known time frame.\nEvery agronomical objects and environmental data stored in Phis field have to be related to an experiment.\nExperiments include both raw and cleaned data.\nThe data types found in Phis experiments are including but not limited to :\n\n\n\n\nphenotypic data\n\n\nenvironmental data\n\n\nanalysis, workflows and their associated results\n\n\ndocuments giving a deeper understanding of the experiments\n\n\n\n\nWhat are experiment properties ?\n\n\nContrary to projects, experiments information sheets are not public, but accessible only to the Phis members which are part of the groups involved in these experiments.\nPlease go to \nAccess rights\n for further details on this matter.\n\n\nFrom the \nExperiments\n menu, a Phis user has access to the list of experiments it has the rights to access to.\nEvery experiment on this list is characterized by :\n\n\n\n\nits \nURI\n which identies it uniquely\n\n\nits \nAlias\n, a short internal denomination\n\n\nits stat and end dates\n\n\nthe experimental installation in which is has been performed\n\n\nthe campaign it is part of, i.e. the year\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nHome / Experiments\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see a given experiment information sheet.\n\n\n\n\nFurther information on the experiment is provided on its information sheet, such as the groups of users that have been given access to the experiment's data.\nFor more detail on experimental data access restrictions, see the section \nRestrictions to a group\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of the experiment information sheet, several buttons are displayed.\nThe buttons \nMap Visualization\n and \nGenerate Map\n enable the visualization of the agronomical objects (e.g. plots) of the experiment on a map centered on the experiment intallation location.\nJump to the section \nMap Visualization\n for more information on experiment maps.\nThe use of the other buttons, \nUpdate\n and \nAdd document\n, is described at the end of the next section entitled \nCreate an experiment\n.\nThe \nAdd annotation\n button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected experiment using the \nWeb Annotation Data Model\n (oa).\nSee the \nAnnotation\n section below for further information on annotations within Phis.\n\n\nCreate an experiment\n\n\nWithin the \nExperiments\n menu, a Phis user can create a new experiment with the\n\nCreate Experiment\n button.\n\n\nTool tips are provided for some fields: they appear on the left hand side when one drags the pointer on those fields.\n\n\nThe mandatory fields, followed by an asterisk, are:\n\n\n\n\nprojects\n\n\ndate (start / end)\n\n\ncampaign\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is highly recommended to fill every field. If possible, fields requiring plain text (keywords, description) should be answered to in English.\n\n\nURI\n. The project URI is automatically created by Phis web service which uses the acronym of the Phis instance from where the experiment is created (e.g. \nDIA\n for Diaphen) and the \ncampaign\n provided by the user (e.g. \n2018\n).\n\n\nAlias\n. Internal name of the experiment, usually provided in all caps.\n\n\nProjects\n. Name of the project(s) the new experiment is part of.\nA single experiment can be linked to several projects.\nOne can select the name of the given projects only within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new experiment is created.\n\n\nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n are to be provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day), directly or through the calendar view.\nIt it compulsory to give a value to the \nDate End\n field in order to create an experiment.\nIf the end date of the experiment is unknown, the start date can be reused in the \nDate End\n field.\nTypical \nDate Start\n values correspond to a sowing date, while \nDate End\n typically concur with an harvesting date.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n. Name or ID of the installation where the experiment is carried.\nNo specific format is yet required for submitting an installation name. \ntodo\n.\n\n\nCampaign\n. Year (format YYYY) in which the experiment has been carried, or the year of the harvest/end of the experiment in case it has been carried on several years (\nto be confirmed\n).\nOnce the experiment created, the information on the campaign in which it has been carried can no longer be modified.\n\n\n\n\nPlace\n. Locality or town name used internally to situate the installation location.\nThis field will later be removed in the upcoming developments of Phis.\n\n\nScientific supervisors\n. Email adresses of the experiment supervisor(s).\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\nIf unavailable in the predefined list, emails can be added to Phis from the \nPersons\n menu, prior to the new project creation. Please see the \nPersons\n section of this documentation for further details.\n\n\nTechnical supervisors\n. Email adresses of the technicians and scientists (including phd students, interns, etc.) involved in the experiment implementation.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nCrop Species\n. Common name of the crop species which are the object of the experiment.\nEach crop species names must be separated by a comm.\nPreferably provided in English, without any capital letters.\nA link to the internal ontology is under development.\n\n\nGroups\n. List of the Phis users groups authorized to access the new experiment.\nThis field is crucial when creating an experiment.\nOnly a Phis user belonging to at least one of the groups specified in this field will be authorized to access the newly created experiment.\nAn experiment assigned to no group is by default set as public.\nPlease go to \nAccess rights\n for further details on this matter.\n\n\nObjective\n. A short synthesis of the experiemnt objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the \nComment\n field.\n\n\nKeywords\n. Keywords characterizing the experiment. Each keyword, should be separated by a comma and not include any capital letter, e.g. \nnitrogen use efficiency, rapeseed\n.\n\n\nComment\n. Complete plain text description of the experiment, preferably provided in English language. Additionally to the description, detailed knowledge on the experimentation can be provided through uploaded files, but only after the experiment has been created.\n\n\nCompleting the experiment creation within Phis is then achieved by clicking on the \nCreate\n button.\n\n\nFrom \nHome / Experiments\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see the newly created experiment information sheet.\n\n\nThe \nAdd document\n button at the top of the experiment information sheet remains orange until a first document has been added, e.g. an experimental design.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on documents.\n\n\nOnce created, the experiment specifics can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button.\n\n\nMap visualization\n\n\nObjects selection\n\n\nAgronomical objects associated with a given experiment, for example plots, can be displayed on a map, thanks to their geopositioning informations.\nIn Phis, a map refers to a dynamic map where all the agronomical objects of a given experiment are represented.\n\n\nAfter having imported agronomical objects linked to an experiment, the map associated with this experiment is created within the \nExperiments\n menu through the \nGenerate Map\n button.\n\n\nOnce the map of an experiment has been created, there's no need to re-create it if no new agronomical object has been linked to this experiment.\nIn such cases, the access to the experiment map is realized within the \nExperiments\n menu through the \nMap Visualization\n button.\n\n\nThe map of an experiment is dynamic: one can zoom in and out with the \n+\n and \n-\n sign at the top left corner of the map, or simply using the mouse wheel.\nThe map visualization also works with a touchscreen.\nMap rotation is performed pressing \nAlt + Shift\n while draging the mouse pointer.\nSelecting multiple contiguous agronomical objects is performed pressing \nCtrl + Left Click\n and then dragging the mouse pointer (still holding the mouse left click).\nSelecting multiple non-contiguous agronomical objects is performed pressing \nCtrl + Shift\n and then using the left-click of the mouse pointer.\n\n\n\n\nWhen agronomical objects of a map are selected, their attributes (alias within the experiment, crop specied, variety, modality, repetition) are displayed in a table under the map.\n\n\n\n\nGraphics from datasets\n\n\nAnother feature provided by the \nMap Visualization\n menu is the possibility to plot graphics from datasets associated to an experiment.\nA first step is to select on the map agronomical objects (e.g. plots) as explained \nabove\n.\nIn order to order to create clear graphics,one should avoid selecting too many objects at the same time.\nAt that point, a new section, \nDataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))\n, appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\nThe second step is to select the variable of the dataset from which a graphic should be produced.\nAn optionnal filter for the graphic creation enables the user to use only data from a specific time window to produce the desired graphic.\n\n\nQuantitative Variable\n. Mandatory field. Here is selected a variable of interest from a predefined list of all the variables defined in a given Phis instance.\nVariables can be selected only one at a time.\nIf the selected variable is associated to no dataset linked to the present experiment, then no graphic is plotted.\nIn the next Phis developments, variables associated a gien project or experimentation will be declared at the level of the project/experimentation.\n\n\nDate Start\n. Optionnal. First date from which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a previous date will not appear in the graphic.\n\n\nDate End\n. Optionnal. Last date at which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a later date will not appear in the graphic.\n\n\nThe last step is to press the \nSearch\n button, which will lead to the creation of a graphic displaying according to a time axis the variable values associated to :\n\n\n\n\nthe agronomical objects selected on the map\n\n\nthe variable selected in the \nQuantitative Variable\n field\n\n\npotentially the time window between \nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n if those fields have been filled out\n\n\n\n\nOn the new graphic, the time is displayed on the abscissa axis and the variable on the ordinate axis.\nEach points of the same color are associated to the same agronomical object which is identified below the graphic by its URI.\nIn future Phis developments, objects alias instead of URIs will be used as curve labels.\nVariable values and curve associated to an agronomical object can be masked by clicking on its associated curve label which at this point changes from black to grey.\nClicking a second time on the label as the effect to show again the previously hidden curve.\n\n\nImages\n\n\nAnother feature provided by the \nMap Visualization\n menu is the possibility to show images associated to an experiment, such as hemispherical images shot on the field.\n\n\nA first step is to select on the map the agronomical object (e.g. plot), as explained \nabove\n, associated with the images you want to visualize.\nDo not select two agronomical objects (or more), otherwise PHIS would look for images associated to both the selected object, while most images are associated to one and only one object.\nAt that point, a new section, \nImages Visualization (On selected plot)\n, appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is to select the type of image you want to display, selecting it from the list of images type, and then press the \nShow Images\n button.\n\n\nDocuments\n\n\nWhat are Phis documents ?\n\n\nIn order to ease the comprehension of projects and experiments, it is possible to upload various documents to Phis and connect them to resources such as infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors or vectors declared in Phis.\n\n\nDocuments that could help persons understand a project are typically a (reasearch) contract, a phd (or master) thesis, or various multimedia content such as photos or beamer presentations.\nSimilarly, one could expect knowledge about an experimentation to be provided through documents that could be protocols, experimental designs, technical or scientific files, data files, research papers, etc.\nExamples of document formats are PDF, txt, csv, png images, etc.\nHowever, large files are not yet supported by Phis: a document uploaded to Phis cannot exceed 2MB for now.\n\n\nThe documents uploaded to Phis through the \nDocuments\n section are meant for human consultation.\nHowever, metadata (intelligible to machines) must be provided for every new document.\nThese metadata contain the document properties:\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\ncreator\n\n\nlanguage\n\n\ncreation date\n\n\ndocument type\n\n\n\n\nInformation of a document can later be changed, while the document itself cannot be modified.\n\n\nMetadata are specified with \nDublin Core\n recommendations.\nMetadata enables the documents to be stored in the Phis triplestore.\nThe expression of Dublin Core metadata using the Resource Description Framework is described at \ndublincore.org\n.\n\n\nUpload a document\n\n\nAny Phis user can upload a new document and specify its metadata with the \nCreate Document\n button displayed on top of the information sheet of any element prone to be enriched with documents (infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors and vectors).\n\n\nNo admin rights are required from a Phis user to add a new document.\n\n\nTitle\n. Title of the uploaded document.\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.\nA document title does not have to match the name of the uploaded file it is imported from.\n\n\nCreator\n. Name(s) of the document creator(s), separated by commas\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.\n\n\nLanguage\n. Language in which the document is provided.\nIn accordance to the \nDublin Core Element Set v1.1\n document, the value of the language element is defined by \nRFC 1766\n which includes a two-character language code taken from the \nISO639\n standard.\nThe language code should be provided in lower case (e.g. \nfr\n for French, \nen\n for English, etc.).\n\n\nCreation Date\n. Date of the document creation.\nIf unknown, the current date (i.e. the date at the moment of the document upload into Phis) can be used.\n\n\nConcerned Projects\n. Project(s) for which the document is relevant.\nOne can select the name of the given project(s) only within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new document is uploaded.\n\n\nConcerned Experimentation\n. Experiment(s) for which the new document is relevant.\nA Phis user can select the name of the given experiment(s) only within the exhaustive list of experiments it has access to.\n\n\nDocument Type\n. The nature of the document's content.\nA single type has to be selected from a predefined list.\nOnly one doucment type can be selected.\nPhis controlled vocabulary of document types is defined in Phis ontology.\nIf an element seems to be missing from the proposed predefined list, please contact Phis managers (see \nREADME.md\n for Phis managers contact).\n\n\nFile\n.\nThis field enables Phis users to upload the new document from their computer through the \nBrowse\n button.\nOnly one document at a time can be created, since every document is identified uniquely through an automatically generated URI.\nThe uploaded file cannot be empty (it has to exceed 0B).\nFor now, a document cannot exceed 2MB, due to technical problems encountered with \nApache\n server.\n\n\nOnce the file has been uploaded, do not click on the \nUpload\n button but \nCreate\n underneath, only when all fields have been completed.\nThe upload button is bound to be abandonned in the following Phis development.\n\n\n\n\nComment\n. Complete plain text description of the new document, preferably provided in English language.\nFor now, line breaks cannot be inserted in a comment : they could generate a bug.\n\n\nClick on the \nCreate\n button to complete the document creation, i.e. the document upload and the specification of its metadata with \nDublin Core\n standards.\n\n\nThe list of documents a given user has access to is avaible from the navigation bar through the \nTools > Documents\n menu.\nFrom \nHome / Documents\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see a given document information sheet (metadata).\nFrom there, the document cannot be modified or deleted (in Phis current version).\nHowever, the document metadata can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button on top of the information sheet.\nThe document can also be downloaded clicking on the \n icon above the \nView / Download\n text, below the information sheet.\n\n\n\n\nAgronomical Objects\n\n\nObject types\n\n\nPlant phenotyping experiments all revolve around one entity of interest : plants !\nPhis experiments are focused on a given type of elements : \nagronomical objects\n, which are no more than declinations of plants, at various scales :\n\n\n\n\nplant organ\n : part of a given plant\n\n\nplant\n : single individual, displaying a single genotype, which is refered to as a \nvariety\n\n\nplot\n : smallest spatial unit, a.k.a micro-plot (one treatment maximum can be applied on a plot)\n\n\nblock\n : combination of plots, generally forming an environmentally homogeneous entity\n\n\nfield\n : large spatial unit that includes plots and potentially blocks\n\n\n\n\nThese agronomical objects, forming the basic units of experimentations, are observed through time, and consequently constitute the origin of phenotypic data.\nA given agronomical object is required to be associated with one experiment, and one only.\nPhenotypic data created in an experiment, whether is it directly measured, calculated or estimated, is necessarily linked to agronomical objects.\n\n\nEvery agronomical object is uniquely identified through a standardized URI.\nMetadata is associate to objects under the form of attributes : alias, experiment modality, etc.\nThe data associated with these objects correspond with the values of phenotypic variables associated\n\n\nThe complete list of agronomical objects is available in the \nAgronomical Objects\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g. \nguestphis\n) is likely to be unable to see the \nAgronomical Objects\n menu, since there are no objects for her/him to see.\nThe agronomical objects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter objects by their URI, Alias, type, and the experience they are linked to.\nThe list of objects associated with a search result, and their metadata, can be retrieved as a .csv file with the \nDownload Search Result\n button.\n\n\n\n\nAgronomical objects information can also be accessed through the \nExperiments\n menu.\nAfter having selected an experiment, the agronomical objects linked to it can be displayed on a map.\nMoreover, selecting objects on such a map provides additional information on the attributes of these objects.\nSee the \nMap Visualization\n section for more information on that matter.\n\n\nImporting plots\n\n\nWithin the \nAgronomical objects\n menu, Phis users can import new plots with the\n\nCreate\n button.\n\n\nPlot, which are agronomical objects, are imported into Phis through a .csv file containing on its first line the following header :\n\n\nAlias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Repetition\n\n\n\n\nEvery other additional line matches with a new plot.\n\n\nLet's take into consideration a fictionnal experiment composed of 4 plots of the same crop (\"species\").\nIn half of the plot, the variety \"A\" of the studied crop is grown, and in the other half, the variety \"B\".\nOf two plots dispaying the same variety, one is submitted to an experiment modality labelled \"treatment 1\", while the other is submitted to a \"treatment 2\".\nExperiments and Species have to be expressed with their internal Phis URI.\nThis configuration is sum up in the following table :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlias\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nExperimentURI\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nVariety\n\n\nExperimentModalities\n\n\nRepetition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot1\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyA\n\n\nTreatment1\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot2\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyA\n\n\nTreatment2\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot3\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyB\n\n\nTreatment1\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot4\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyB\n\n\nTreatment2\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file necessary to import those four plots is a 5 line csv file: after the header, every line of the imported file needs to display the 7 required elements separated by semicolons :\n\n\nAlias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Repetition\nplot1;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot2;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment2;Rep1\nplot3;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot4;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment2;Rep1\n\n\n\n\nA single plot cannot correspond to several species, variety, experimental modality or repetition.\nOn the contrary, the same species, variety, experimental modality or repetition can be used for several plots.\n\n\nPlots are geometrical objects such as polygons, provided according to \nWell-known text standard\n).\nGeometry coordinates are formatted in \nWGS84\n, alsa known as the \nEPSG4326\n geodetic coordinate system.\nMore information on this system \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe first step in order to import plots is therefore to create a .csv file containing all the new plots information, as is reminded below :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlias\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nExperimentURI\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nVariety\n\n\nExperimentModalities\n\n\nRepetition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpX_modY_plotZ\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nhttp://www.phenome-fppn.fr/.../...\n\n\nhttp://www.phenome-fppn.fr/id/species/...\n\n\ne.g. varietyX\n\n\ne.g. nitrogen-1\n\n\ne.g. 1 (or A-I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHe second step is to import the .csv file through the \nBrowse\n button, at the bottom right of the \nHome / Agronomical Objects / Create Agronomical Object\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nUse the file browser to select the desired .csv file and open it.\n\n\n\n\nCheck the imported file but do not press the Upload button.\nOnly on file at a time can be imported.\n\n\n\n\nAfter having pressed the \nCreate\n bottom button the number of imported agronomical objects is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nVisualize agronomical objects\n\n\nSee \nMap Visualization\n section.\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nVariables properties\n\n\nPhis variables characterize Phis \nagronomical objects\n or their \nenvironment\n.\nVariables characterizing agronomical objects are \nphenotypic variables\n, while variables characterizing the environment in which those agronomical objects are studied are refered to as \nenvironmental variables\n.\nPhis variables can be either directly mesured by a sensor, either computed from one or several variables.\n\n\nEvery variable produced by an experiment must have been previously created in Phis, and every variable created in Phis has to be defined unambuigusously.\nConsequently, when a user refers to a variable in an experiment, there is no ambiguity about the concept he is refering to.\nMoreover, the usage of unequivocal variables in experiments is a necessary step towards a more intelligible, reliable and reproducible Science.\n\n\nPhis variables are listed in the \nVariables\n menu.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g. \nguestphis\n) is likely to be unable to see the \nVariables\n menu, since there is no variable for her/him to see.\n\n\nVariable definition is based on the \nCrop Ontology guidelines\n.\nTherefore, Phis variables are all unequivocally characterized by the following triplet:\n\n\n\n\na single \ntrait\n, either a phenotypic trait or an environmental feature, which is the subject of the new variable\n\n\na single \nmethod\n of measurement or computation of the trait\n\n\na single \nunit\n in which is expressed the value of the trait\n\n\n\n\nFurther information on a given variable is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the variables list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.\n\n\n\n\nA variable information sheet provides knowledge on this variable, but also on the three elements that define it, namely the \ntrait\n, \nmethod\n and \nunit\n related to this variable.\nThe variable and those three defining features all display a \nlabel\n, that should be meaningful and unique, but does not have to be so, an \nURI\n which is however unique, a \nDefinition\n (or \nComment\n) meant for human comprehension, and \nrelated references\n meant for Semantic Web applications.\nReference to external ontologies is achieved through \nSKOS\n standards\n\n\nNB: for now, only phenotypic variables are present\n\n\nCreate variables, traits, methods and units\n\n\nEvery variable found on Phis has been previously created by a Phis user.\nWithin the \nVariables\n menu, one can create a new project with the\n\nCreate Variable\n button.\n\n\nVariable label\n. This field is automatically produced with the concatenation of the trait, method and unit labels, separated by underscores.\nThe resulting variable label is not necessarily unique, but it would be better if it was.\nOn the contrary, the automatically generated URI (not shown in the \nCreate Variable\n menu) is unique.\n\n\nTrait\n. If the trait associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the \nTrait label\n field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nTrait label\n field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a new trait, do not fill the \nTrait label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new trait label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other trait labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided since trait, method and unit labels are concatenated to generate the new variable name with the format \nTrait_Method_Unit\n.\n\n\nA \nComment\n should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the trait specifics as clearly as possible.\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n. If the method associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the \nMethod label\n field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nMethod label\n field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a new method, do not fill the \nMethod label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new method label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other method labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.\n\n\nA \nComment\n should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the method specifics as clearly as possible.\n\n\nUnit\n. If the unit associated to the new variable cannot be found on the \nUnit label\n predefined list, a new unit has to be created.\nThis can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nUnit label\n field.\nIn the case of a new unit, do not fill the \nUnit label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new unit label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other unit labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.\n\n\nOtherwise, if the appropriate unit is already register in Phis, then one only has to select it from the \nUnit label\n field, without clicking on the \n+\n green icon (or clicking on the \n-\n red icon if the \n+\n green icon had previously been clicked on).\n\n\nIn the tricky case of a variable presenting no unit (e.g. pH), it is advised to crete a new unit whose label would be : dimensionless_unit_\nvariable-name\n (e.g. dimensionless_unit_pH).\nIt matters in order not to use the same \"unit\" for every variable displaying a dimensionless unit.\nMore on this topic on the \nontobee.org\n website.\n\n\n\n\nRelated References\n.\nIn order to unambiguously define the new variable, semantic relations are established by the user between the new variable and concepts already defined in reliable ontologies existing on the world wide web.\nThese relations to external ontologies are established using \nSKOS\n (Simple Knowledge Organization System).\n\n\nEntity\n refers to the Phis entity that will be associated to a concept found in an ontology.\nThis \nEntity\n be either the new variable, trait, method or unit.\nIt is not required to specify related concepts for traits, methods and units, however it is recommanded.\n\n\nRelation\n refers to the nature of the relation between the entity and the concept defined in an ontology.\nThis semantic relation is provided using SKOS.\nThe entity can either be, compared to an ontology concept, an \nexact match\n, a \nclose match\n, \nnarrower\n or \nbroader\n.\n\n\nSKOS mapping properties, \nskos:closeMatch\n and \nskos:exactMatch\n, are used to state alignement links between SKOS concepts, as indicated in the \nw3 SKOS Mapping properties web page\n :\n\n\n\n\nexactMatch\n : used to link two concepts, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications. \nskos:exactMatch\n is a transitive property, and is a sub-property of \nskos:closeMatch\n. \nExample: \n<MyNewNDVIVariable> skos:exactMatch <CO_322:0000880>\n asserts that the variable 'MyNewNDVIVariable' created in Phis refers to the exact same concept as does the variable 'NDVI_M_idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000880'\n\n\ncloseMatch\n : used to link two concepts that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid the possibility of \"compound errors\" when combining mappings across more than two concept schemes, \nskos:closeMatch\n is not declared to be a transitive property. \nExample: \n<MyNewLAIVariable> skos:closeMatch <http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_321:0001254>\n asserts that the variable 'MyNewLAIVariable' created in Phis is very similar to the variable 'LAI_Calc_Idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_321:0001254'\n\n\n\n\nSKOS hierarchical properties \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are used to assert a direct hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts, as indicated in the \nw3 Semantic Relations web page\n :\n\n\n\n\nbroader\n (label=\nhas broader\n) : a triple \n<A> skos:broader <B>\n asserts that \n<B>\n, the object of the triple, is a broader concept than \n<A>\n, the subject of the triple. \nExample: \n<MyNewPlantHeightTrait> skos:broader <CO_322:0000994>\n asserts that the trait 'MyNewPlantHeightTrait' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a broader one: which is the concept refered to by the trait 'Plant height' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000994'\n\n\nnarrower\n (label=\nhas narrower\n)  :  a triple \n<C> skos:narrower <D>\n asserts that \n<D>\n, the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than \n<C>\n, the subject of the triple. \nskos:broader\n is \nowl:inverseOf\n the property \nskos:narrower\n.  \nExample: \n<MyNewStageEstimationMethod> skos:narrower <http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/>\n asserts that the method 'MyNewStageEstimationMethod' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a narrower one, which is the concept refered to by the method 'Silking date - Estimation' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/'\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are only used to assert a direct (i.e., immediate) hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. This provides applications with a convenient and reliable way to access the direct broader and narrower links for any given concept. Note that, to support this usage convention, the properties \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are not declared as transitive properties.\n\n\nReference URI\n refers to the URI of the concept found on ontologies such as the ones suggested in the short list above the \nRelated References\n field.\nThe URI provided here is not necessarily the URL of the web page of the ontology on which the targeted concept is defined.\nIndeed, the URI of a given concept does not necessarily match with the URL of the web page where this concept has been found.\n\nExample : http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nWARNING : using the identifier (e.g. CO_322:0000907) is not sufficient.\n\n\nHyperlink\n (optionnal) refers to the URL where are located the related concept whose URI has been provided in the previous field.\n\nExample : http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the hyperlink (URL) associated to the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nIn this example, the URI of the concept is also an URL (a hyperlink), but it is not the case for every ontology.\n\n\nWhen a variable is created, multiple references using SKOS can be stated, using the \n+\n white icon.\n\n\n\n\nWhich portals provide a link towards various ontologies ?\n\n\nThe \nAgroPortal\n project aims to offer a reference ontology repository for agronomy, reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology, as stated on the \nFAO website\n.\nThe scientific outcomes and the experience of the biomdical domain are thus exploited and transposed into the agronomy domain, including plants, food, environment and possibly animal sciences.\n\n\nThe \nEphesis Ontotology Portal\n  is a JavaScript widget displaying all the observation variables of a Breeding API endpoint.\nIt lists ontologies available with the BreedingAPI/CropOntology JSON format.\n\n\nHere are some examples of ontologies :\n\n\nThe \nCrop Ontology (CO)\n current objective is to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of crops, on trait mesurement and methods, as well as on germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms.\n\n\nThe \nPlant Ontology (PO)\n is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology, growth and development to plant genomics data.\nThe URL provided \nhere\n redirects visitors to the Planteome website since PO is developed by the Planteome Project, alongside with other reference ontologies listed in the \nPlanteome Ontologies webpage\n.\nThe \nPlanteome\n project is a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to access plant genomics data.\n\n\nThe \nUnit Ontology\n gathers metrical units for use in conjunction with \nPATO\n (Phenotype And Trait Ontology), which is a phenotypic quality ontology.\n\n\nWhich other ressources, besides ontologies, can I link my variables to ?\n\n\nAGROVOC\n is a controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, etc.\nIt is published by the FAO and edited by a community of experts.\nMore information is provided on the \nFAO website\n.\n\n\nVariable Definition\n. Text defining clearly the concept underlying the new variable.\nThis definition should ideally be provided in English.\n\n\nModifiy existing variables\n\n\nSo far, it is not possible to modify or delete an existing variable, other than by asking a Phis developper.\n\n\nDataset\n\n\nDataset properties\n\n\nThe heart of experiments is to produce datasets associated with the agronomical variables it studies.\nIn Phis, each dataset is associated to an experiment.\nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping platforms commonly set up experiments in which plant growth is monitored.\nPlant growth dynamcis are analyzed through the evolution of various variable (e.g. LAI, NDVI, etc.) through time.\n\n\nAt this stage of development, all dataset variables are quantitative.\nNo qualitative variables are saved in the datasets : a variable from a dataset can only assume numerical values and no character string is allowed.\n\n\nA dataset typically displays information on many agronomical objects.\nThese objects can be described by several variables.\nEach one of these variables can assume diverse values at different dates.\nIn order to avoid confusion, each element of a dataset should then be understood as a triplet object-time-variable.\nThus, each element of a dataset is associated uniquely with :\n\n\n\n\na single agronomical object (e.g. a plot)\n\n\na single date (the day of the data acquisition)\n\n\na single variable (a quantitative variable used to monitor the measured or calculated trait)\n\n\na single variable numerical value (the value of the variable cited above)\n\n\n\n\nDatasets are available indirectly through the \nExperiments\n menu, selecting an experiment and then accessing to its map through the \nMap Visualization\n button.\n\n\nGraphics can be extracted from the experiment datasets in the \nDataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))\n section, which appears under the map of the experiment when agronomical objects are selected.\nHow to create such graphics is explained in the \nMap Visualization\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nImport Dataset\n\n\nDatasets can be added to Phis through the \nDataset\n menu in the top navigation bar.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g. \nguestphis\n) is likely to be unable to see the \nDataset\n menu.\nIndeed, only users that are part of an owner group are authorized to add datasets to the experiments associated to this group.\nGo to the \nGroups level of access\n section for further information on this issue.\n\n\nWhen adding a dataset to Phis, three types of elements can be created :\n\n\n\n\nthe dataset itself, as a .csv file\n\n\nthe metadata associated to this dataset (e.g. variables in the dataset, creation date, etc.)\n\n\noptionnal documents associated to the dataset\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Variable\n. Mandatory field. Variable or list of the variables found in the added dataset.\nThe variable(s) must have previously been defined in Phis (see \nVariables\n).\n\n\nDataset Creation Date\n. Mandatory field. Date in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format matching to the day in which the imported data has been generated.\nLet's take the example of a drone flight performed two weeks before the data import, followed by the production of clean data from the flight images one week before the import.\nThe imported data is the clean data created one week before the data import.\nTherefore, the date to provide in \nDataset Creation Date\n is the one corresponding to one week before the data import.\nThis field is necessary for provenance purposes.\n\n\nWas generated By\n.\nOptionnal document giving indications on how the data has been created.\nIf a single script (e.g. in R or python language) has been used to create the imported data, it should be uploaded here.\nIf the data creation process has been more complex, a document (e.g. PDF or text) could be provided to describe it.\nThe document import is performed via the \nAdd Document Script\n button.\nThe metadata to provide is the same as in any Phis document, see the \nUpload a document\n section.\nOnly one document can be added to this field.\nMore documents can be imported together with the dataset through the \nLinked Document(s)\n field.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n.  Informative plain text description of how the imported data has been generated, preferably provided in English language.\nFor instance, if the data has been generated with Phenoscript v1.2, one can mention it here, especially if the concerned script cannot be imported.\n\n\nLinked Document(s)\n.\nAdditionnal documents associated with the dataset and imported to Phis.\nClick on the \nAdd Document\n button and then fill out the usual document creation form as described in the \nUpload a document\n section.\nMultiple documents can be uploaded and associated to the imported dataset.\nClick several times on \nAdd Document\n in order to add several documents.\n\n\n\n\nData File\n. This mandatory field is used by users to upload the dataset from their computer through the \nBrowse\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset added to Phis must respect some file rules :\n\n\n\n\nthe file must be a .csv file\n\n\nthe first line of the file is a header, every other additional row matches with a new element characterized by a single agronomical object, a single date and as many variable values as there are variables\n\n\nin a given row, each items are separated by a single semicolon \n;\n\n\nthe header contains the fields \nAgronomicalObjectURI\n and \nDate\n, and as many variable alias as there are added variables (see the .csv template that can be downloaded above the \nData File\n field)\n\n\nthe agronomical objects are refered to by their respective URI\n\n\nthe date is refered to in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-date) format\n\n\nvariable values are provided as real number, since Phis then stores numbers as \ndouble-precision floating-point value\n\n\nnumerical values decimal separators should be dots \n.\n but commas \n,\n are tolerated\n\n\nno character strings, \"NA\" included, are tolerated as variable values : if a variable value is unknown, do not write anything (see example below)\n\n\nno quotes for URIs, dates or variable values\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the added dataset exhibits information on two objects, one of them (URI1) displaying values for one variable at three different dates, and the other one (URI2) displaying values for two variables at the same dates :\n\n\nAgronomicalObjectURI;Date;VariableAlias1;VariableAlias2\nURI1;2017-04-01;;5\nURI1;2017-04-15;;10.0\nURI1;2017-04-31;;12.00\nURI2;2017-04-01;3.22;6\nURI2;2017-04-15;4.12;9\nURI2;2017-04-31;5.347687869;10\n\n\n\n\nThe URI of the agronomical objects of a given experimentation can be found on the \nAgronomical Objects\n menu, using search filters, and then downloaded with the \nDownload Search Result\n button (see the \nObject types\n of this documentation).\nAll variables values of the imported dataset are associated with agronomical objects that must have been previously declared in Phis (see \nImporting plots\n).\n\n\nThe data file imported in Phis can displays many fields (i.e. number of items in the header), but only the column matching with the expected fields will be kept.\nThe expected fields and their name are provided in the .csv template provide by the \nDownload Template\n link above the \nData File\n field.\nHence, users can copy and paste their data in the template file (keeping the header unchanged), or import directly their datasheet as a .csv, after having renamed correctly the fields as described in the template.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to finalize the addition of the dataset, click on the bottom \nCreate\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe waiting time following the use of the \nCreate\n button can relatively long, depending on the quantity of variable values added.\nIf an error occurs, the dataset is not added to Phis and an error message is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nElse, the dataset is imported in Phis and a success message is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nAt the current stage of Phis development, datasets cannot be modified nor deleted once it has been added to Phis.\n\n\nVisualize Dataset\n\n\nGraphics extracted from Phis datasets are available through the \nExperiments\n menu.\nSee the \nMap Visualization\n section of this documentation for further information.\n\n\nAnnotations\n\n\nWhat are annotations ?\n\n\nAnnotations are comments made on an element of Phis and stored as metadata linked to this element.\nMore broadly, \nthe W3C\n describes annotations as \"typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources\".\nAn annotation can be an explanation given by the creator of a resource, an expert viewpoint or the input of other persons.\nPhis projects, experiments, sensors, vectors, etc. (any element displaying an URI) can be annotated using the W3C specifications of the \nWeb Annotation Data model\n, or \noa\n (prefix of the Web Annotation Data Model, whose namespace is \nhttp://www.w3.org/ns/oa#\n).\nAny user can therefore enrich Phis elements with attached information (metadata) using semantic annotations.\n\n\nAdd annotation\n\n\nAnnotations can be added to Phis through the \nAdd annotation\n button of the information sheet of any project, experiment, sensor or vector.\n\n\nCreator\n. The username of the creator of the annotation (you) is automatically recorded by Phis whenever you create an annotation.\n\n\nMotivated by\n. Following W3C recommendations on \nannotation motivations\n, when creating an annotation you need to select through the controlled vocabulary of \noa\n the motivation category matching the reason why you are creating this annotation :\n\n\n\n\nassessing\n : used when the annotation is a comment or a quality assessment\n\n\nclassifying\n : used when the annotation is an attempt to classify the resource annotated\n\n\nediting\n : used when the annotation is a request to edit or delete a resource\n\n\netc. See \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose\n for the exhaustive list of annotation motivations\n\n\n\n\nCreation Date\n. Automatically set by Phis using the local time.\n\n\nTargets\n. Automatically set by Phis, this field records the resource (e.g. experiment) from which an annotation creation has been requested by the user (i.e. from which resource he clicked on the \nAdd annotation\n button).\n\n\nDescription\n.

A research project is the higher level of organisation in Phis.\nIt is generally the object of a contract or a grant agreement between the laboratory performing the research activities and funding agencies providing the financial support.\nA project can hold many experiments from various experimental campaigns.\nBesides, several projects can participate to the same experimentation.  What are project properties ?  Projects fact sheets are all public, i.e. visible for every Phis user, including those unrelated to them.\nHowever, experimental data included in a project is also necessarily related to a given experiment.\nThis data is accessible only to users who belong to a group (either owner or guest) authorized to access the experimentation it is related to: access rights are managed by experiment and not by project.\nPlease see the  Restrictions to a group  section of this documentation for further details on data access matters.  The complete list of projects is available in the  Experimental organization / Projects  menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nThe projects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter projects by their acronym, their main source of funding, and their start and end dates.\nThere's no need to use the same case as the expected results: a lowercase search returns every results matching the characters, disregarding whether those match are lowercase or uppercase.\nFurther information on a given project is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the projects list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.   A project information sheet displays all this project information stored in Phis : URI, acronyme, objective, start and end dates, contacts linked to the project, a description, etc.\nDocuments (PDF, tables, etc.) can also be linked to a project.\nAt the top of the project information sheet lie three buttons allowing the user to interact with the selected project.   The project specifics, displayed in the information sheet, can be modified with the  Update  button.  Another top button is the  Add document  button which remains orange until a first document has been added.\nSee the  Documents  section below for further information on Phis documents and for learning how to insert them in the information system.  The  Add annotation  button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected project using the  Web Annotation Data Model  (oa).\nSee the  Annotation  section below for further information on annotations within Phis.

Name . Full name of the project, it will seldom be refered to but allows a project creator to explicit the acronym. For instance,  RAPeSeed Oil content anD Yield under low Nitrogen input  would be an adequate name for the project whose acronym is  RAPSODYN .  Subproject Of . If the new project is part of an existing project (requisitly known to Phis), one can select the name of the given mother-project within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new project is created.  Subproject Type . The subproject type can optionnaly be provided. It can be either an existing type to be selected from the list of proposed project types, either a new type provided by the user. In the later case, one has to type the new subproject type (e.g.  phd thesis  or  internship ) in the search field of  Subproject Type  and then click on the newly proposed type.   Objective . A short synthesis of the project objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the  Description  field.  Financial Support . Organism, institution or funding agency providing the financial support of the research project. Only one organism supporting financially the project can be cited for now. Same as the  Subproject Type  field, the answer can be both from a predefined list or a new one (the user has to type the new organism name and then click on the search result matching the organism name).

Objective . A short synthesis of the experiemnt objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the  Comment  field.  Keywords . Keywords characterizing the experiment. Each keyword, should be separated by a comma and not include any capital letter, e.g.  nitrogen use efficiency, rapeseed .  Comment . Complete plain text description of the experiment, preferably provided in English language. Additionally to the description, detailed knowledge on the experimentation can be provided through uploaded files, but only after the experiment has been created.  Completing the experiment creation within Phis is then achieved by clicking on the  Create  button.  From  Home / Experiments , one can click on the eye icon on the right to see the newly created experiment information sheet.  The  Add document  button at the top of the experiment information sheet remains orange until a first document has been added, e.g. an experimental design.\nSee the  Documents  section below for further information on documents.  Once created, the experiment specifics can be modified with the  Update  button.  Map visualization  Objects selection  Agronomical objects associated with a given experiment, for example plots, can be displayed on a map, thanks to their geopositioning informations.\nIn Phis, a map refers to a dynamic map where all the agronomical objects of a given experiment are represented.  After having imported agronomical objects linked to an experiment, the map associated with this experiment is created within the  Experiments  menu through the  Generate Map  button.  Once the map of an experiment has been created, there's no need to re-create it if no new agronomical object has been linked to this experiment.\nIn such cases, the access to the experiment map is realized within the  Experiments  menu through the  Map Visualization  button.  The map of an experiment is dynamic: one can zoom in and out with the  +  and  -  sign at the top left corner of the map, or simply using the mouse wheel.\nThe map visualization also works with a touchscreen.\nMap rotation is performed pressing  Alt + Shift  while draging the mouse pointer.\nSelecting multiple contiguous agronomical objects is performed pressing  Ctrl + Left Click  and then dragging the mouse pointer (still holding the mouse left click).\nSelecting multiple non-contiguous agronomical objects is performed pressing  Ctrl + Shift  and then using the left-click of the mouse pointer.   When agronomical objects of a map are selected, their attributes (alias within the experiment, crop specied, variety, modality, repetition) are displayed in a table under the map.   Graphics from datasets  Another feature provided by the  Map Visualization  menu is the possibility to plot graphics from datasets associated to an experiment.\nA first step is to select on the map agronomical objects (e.g. plots) as explained  above .\nIn order to order to create clear graphics,one should avoid selecting too many objects at the same time.\nAt that point, a new section,  Dataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s)) , appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\nThe second step is to select the variable of the dataset from which a graphic should be produced.\nAn optionnal filter for the graphic creation enables the user to use only data from a specific time window to produce the desired graphic.  Quantitative Variable . Mandatory field. Here is selected a variable of interest from a predefined list of all the variables defined in a given Phis instance.\nVariables can be selected only one at a time.\nIf the selected variable is associated to no dataset linked to the present experiment, then no graphic is plotted.\nIn the next Phis developments, variables associated a gien project or experimentation will be declared at the level of the project/experimentation.  Date Start . Optionnal. First date from which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a previous date will not appear in the graphic.  Date End . Optionnal. Last date at which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a later date will not appear in the graphic.  The last step is to press the  Search  button, which will lead to the creation of a graphic displaying according to a time axis the variable values associated to :   the agronomical objects selected on the map  the variable selected in the  Quantitative Variable  field  potentially the time window between  Date Start  and  Date End  if those fields have been filled out   On the new graphic, the time is displayed on the abscissa axis and the variable on the ordinate axis.\nEach points of the same color are associated to the same agronomical object which is identified below the graphic by its URI.\nIn future Phis developments, objects alias instead of URIs will be used as curve labels.\nVariable values and curve associated to an agronomical object can be masked by clicking on its associated curve label which at this point changes from black to grey.\nClicking a second time on the label as the effect to show again the previously hidden curve.  Images  Another feature provided by the  Map Visualization  menu is the possibility to show images associated to an experiment, such as hemispherical images shot on the field.  A first step is to select on the map the agronomical object (e.g. plot), as explained  above , associated with the images you want to visualize.\nDo not select two agronomical objects (or more), otherwise PHIS would look for images associated to both the selected object, while most images are associated to one and only one object.\nAt that point, a new section,  Images Visualization (On selected plot) , appears under the map where the objects have been selected.   The second step is to select the type of image you want to display, selecting it from the list of images type, and then press the  Show Images  button.",

Importing plots  Within the  Agronomical objects  menu, Phis users can import new plots with the Create  button.  Plot, which are agronomical objects, are imported into Phis through a .csv file containing on its first line the following header :  Alias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Repetition  Every other additional line matches with a new plot.  Let's take into consideration a fictionnal experiment composed of 4 plots of the same crop (\"species\").\nIn half of the plot, the variety \"A\" of the studied crop is grown, and in the other half, the variety \"B\".\nOf two plots dispaying the same variety, one is submitted to an experiment modality labelled \"treatment 1\", while the other is submitted to a \"treatment 2\".\nExperiments and Species have to be expressed with their internal Phis URI.\nThis configuration is sum up in the following table :     Alias  Geometry  ExperimentURI  Species  Variety  ExperimentModalities  Repetition      plot1  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyA  Treatment1  Rep1    plot2  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyA  Treatment2  Rep1    plot3  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyB  Treatment1  Rep1    plot4  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyB  Treatment2  Rep1     The file necessary to import those four plots is a 5 line csv file: after the header, every line of the imported file needs to display the 7 required elements separated by semicolons :  Alias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Repetition\nplot1;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot2;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment2;Rep1\nplot3;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot4;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment2;Rep1  A single plot cannot correspond to several species, variety, experimental modality or repetition.\nOn the contrary, the same species, variety, experimental modality or repetition can be used for several plots.

Every variable produced by an experiment must have been previously created in Phis, and every variable created in Phis has to be defined unambuigusously.\nConsequently, when a user refers to a variable in an experiment, there is no ambiguity about the concept he is refering to.\nMoreover, the usage of unequivocal variables in experiments is a necessary step towards a more intelligible, reliable and reproducible Science.  Phis variables are listed in the  Variables  menu.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g.  guestphis ) is likely to be unable to see the  Variables  menu, since there is no variable for her/him to see.  Variable definition is based on the  Crop Ontology guidelines .\nTherefore, Phis variables are all unequivocally characterized by the following triplet:   a single  trait , either a phenotypic trait or an environmental feature, which is the subject of the new variable  a single  method  of measurement or computation of the trait  a single  unit  in which is expressed the value of the trait   Further information on a given variable is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the variables list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.   A variable information sheet provides knowledge on this variable, but also on the three elements that define it, namely the  trait ,  method  and  unit  related to this variable.\nThe variable and those three defining features all display a  label , that should be meaningful and unique, but does not have to be so, an  URI  which is however unique, a  Definition  (or  Comment ) meant for human comprehension, and  related references  meant for Semantic Web applications.\nReference to external ontologies is achieved through  SKOS  standards  NB: for now, only phenotypic variables are present  Create variables, traits, methods and units  Every variable found on Phis has been previously created by a Phis user.\nWithin the  Variables  menu, one can create a new project with the Create Variable  button.  Variable label . This field is automatically produced with the concatenation of the trait, method and unit labels, separated by underscores.\nThe resulting variable label is not necessarily unique, but it would be better if it was.\nOn the contrary, the automatically generated URI (not shown in the  Create Variable  menu) is unique.  Trait . If the trait associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the  Trait label  field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the  +  green icon on the right-hand side of the  Trait label  field.   In the case of a new trait, do not fill the  Trait label  field but the  Internal label  one, below the  -  red icon that replaced the  +  green icon.\nThis new trait label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other trait labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided since trait, method and unit labels are concatenated to generate the new variable name with the format  Trait_Method_Unit .

A  Comment  should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the method specifics as clearly as possible.  Unit . If the unit associated to the new variable cannot be found on the  Unit label  predefined list, a new unit has to be created.\nThis can be achieved by clicking on the  +  green icon on the right-hand side of the  Unit label  field.\nIn the case of a new unit, do not fill the  Unit label  field but the  Internal label  one, below the  -  red icon that replaced the  +  green icon.\nThis new unit label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other unit labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.  Otherwise, if the appropriate unit is already register in Phis, then one only has to select it from the  Unit label  field, without clicking on the  +  green icon (or clicking on the  -  red icon if the  +  green icon had previously been clicked on).  In the tricky case of a variable presenting no unit (e.g. pH), it is advised to crete a new unit whose label would be : dimensionless_unit_ variable-name  (e.g. dimensionless_unit_pH).\nIt matters in order not to use the same \"unit\" for every variable displaying a dimensionless unit.\nMore on this topic on the  ontobee.org  website.   Related References .\nIn order to unambiguously define the new variable, semantic relations are established by the user between the new variable and concepts already defined in reliable ontologies existing on the world wide web.\nThese relations to external ontologies are established using  SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System).  Entity  refers to the Phis entity that will be associated to a concept found in an ontology.\nThis  Entity  be either the new variable, trait, method or unit.\nIt is not required to specify related concepts for traits, methods and units, however it is recommanded.  Relation  refers to the nature of the relation between the entity and the concept defined in an ontology.\nThis semantic relation is provided using SKOS.\nThe entity can either be, compared to an ontology concept, an  exact match , a  close match ,  narrower  or  broader .  SKOS mapping properties,  skos:closeMatch  and  skos:exactMatch , are used to state alignement links between SKOS concepts, as indicated in the  w3 SKOS Mapping properties web page  :   exactMatch  : used to link two concepts, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications.  skos:exactMatch  is a transitive property, and is a sub-property of  skos:closeMatch .  Example:  <MyNewNDVIVariable> skos:exactMatch <CO_322:0000880>  asserts that the variable 'MyNewNDVIVariable' created in Phis refers to the exact same concept as does the variable 'NDVI_M_idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000880'  closeMatch  : used to link two concepts that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid the possibility of \"compound errors\" when combining mappings across more than two concept schemes,  skos:closeMatch  is not declared to be a transitive property.  Example:  <MyNewLAIVariable> skos:closeMatch <http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_321:0001254>  asserts that the variable 'MyNewLAIVariable' created in Phis is very similar to the variable 'LAI_Calc_Idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_321:0001254'   SKOS hierarchical properties  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are used to assert a direct hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts, as indicated in the  w3 Semantic Relations web page  :   broader  (label= has broader ) : a triple  <A> skos:broader <B>  asserts that  <B> , the object of the triple, is a broader concept than  <A> , the subject of the triple.  Example:  <MyNewPlantHeightTrait> skos:broader <CO_322:0000994>  asserts that the trait 'MyNewPlantHeightTrait' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a broader one: which is the concept refered to by the trait 'Plant height' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000994'  narrower  (label= has narrower )  :  a triple  <C> skos:narrower <D>  asserts that  <D> , the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than  <C> , the subject of the triple.  skos:broader  is  owl:inverseOf  the property  skos:narrower .   Example:  <MyNewStageEstimationMethod> skos:narrower <http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/>  asserts that the method 'MyNewStageEstimationMethod' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a narrower one, which is the concept refered to by the method 'Silking date - Estimation' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/'   By convention,  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are only used to assert a direct (i.e., immediate) hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. This provides applications with a convenient and reliable way to access the direct broader and narrower links for any given concept. Note that, to support this usage convention, the properties  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are not declared as transitive properties.  Reference URI  refers to the URI of the concept found on ontologies such as the ones suggested in the short list above the  Related References  field.\nThe URI provided here is not necessarily the URL of the web page of the ontology on which the targeted concept is defined.\nIndeed, the URI of a given concept does not necessarily match with the URL of the web page where this concept has been found. Example : http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nWARNING : using the identifier (e.g. CO_322:0000907) is not sufficient.  Hyperlink  (optionnal) refers to the URL where are located the related concept whose URI has been provided in the previous field. Example : http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the hyperlink (URL) associated to the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nIn this example, the URI of the concept is also an URL (a hyperlink), but it is not the case for every ontology.  When a variable is created, multiple references using SKOS can be stated, using the  +  white icon.   Which portals provide a link towards various ontologies ?  The  AgroPortal  project aims to offer a reference ontology repository for agronomy, reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology, as stated on the  FAO website .\nThe scientific outcomes and the experience of the biomdical domain are thus exploited and transposed into the agronomy domain, including plants, food, environment and possibly animal sciences.  The  Ephesis Ontotology Portal   is a JavaScript widget displaying all the observation variables of a Breeding API endpoint.\nIt lists ontologies available with the BreedingAPI/CropOntology JSON format.  Here are some examples of ontologies :  The  Crop Ontology (CO)  current objective is to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of crops, on trait mesurement and methods, as well as on germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms.  The  Plant Ontology (PO)  is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology, growth and development to plant genomics data.\nThe URL provided  here  redirects visitors to the Planteome website since PO is developed by the Planteome Project, alongside with other reference ontologies listed in the  Planteome Ontologies webpage .\nThe  Planteome  project is a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to access plant genomics data.  The  Unit Ontology  gathers metrical units for use in conjunction with  PATO  (Phenotype And Trait Ontology), which is a phenotypic quality ontology.  Which other ressources, besides ontologies, can I link my variables to ?  AGROVOC  is a controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, etc.\nIt is published by the FAO and edited by a community of experts.\nMore information is provided on the  FAO website .

            "text": "Dataset properties  The heart of experiments is to produce datasets associated with the agronomical variables it studies.\nIn Phis, each dataset is associated to an experiment.\nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping platforms commonly set up experiments in which plant growth is monitored.\nPlant growth dynamcis are analyzed through the evolution of various variable (e.g. LAI, NDVI, etc.) through time.  At this stage of development, all dataset variables are quantitative.\nNo qualitative variables are saved in the datasets : a variable from a dataset can only assume numerical values and no character string is allowed.  A dataset typically displays information on many agronomical objects.\nThese objects can be described by several variables.\nEach one of these variables can assume diverse values at different dates.\nIn order to avoid confusion, each element of a dataset should then be understood as a triplet object-time-variable.\nThus, each element of a dataset is associated uniquely with :   a single agronomical object (e.g. a plot)  a single date (the day of the data acquisition)  a single variable (a quantitative variable used to monitor the measured or calculated trait)  a single variable numerical value (the value of the variable cited above)   Datasets are available indirectly through the  Experiments  menu, selecting an experiment and then accessing to its map through the  Map Visualization  button.  Graphics can be extracted from the experiment datasets in the  Dataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))  section, which appears under the map of the experiment when agronomical objects are selected.\nHow to create such graphics is explained in the  Map Visualization  section of this documentation.  Import Dataset  Datasets can be added to Phis through the  Dataset  menu in the top navigation bar.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g.  guestphis ) is likely to be unable to see the  Dataset  menu.\nIndeed, only users that are part of an owner group are authorized to add datasets to the experiments associated to this group.\nGo to the  Groups level of access  section for further information on this issue.  When adding a dataset to Phis, three types of elements can be created :   the dataset itself, as a .csv file  the metadata associated to this dataset (e.g. variables in the dataset, creation date, etc.)  optionnal documents associated to the dataset   Quantitative Variable . Mandatory field. Variable or list of the variables found in the added dataset.\nThe variable(s) must have previously been defined in Phis (see  Variables ).  Dataset Creation Date . Mandatory field. Date in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format matching to the day in which the imported data has been generated.\nLet's take the example of a drone flight performed two weeks before the data import, followed by the production of clean data from the flight images one week before the import.\nThe imported data is the clean data created one week before the data import.\nTherefore, the date to provide in  Dataset Creation Date  is the one corresponding to one week before the data import.\nThis field is necessary for provenance purposes.  Was generated By .\nOptionnal document giving indications on how the data has been created.\nIf a single script (e.g. in R or python language) has been used to create the imported data, it should be uploaded here.\nIf the data creation process has been more complex, a document (e.g. PDF or text) could be provided to describe it.\nThe document import is performed via the  Add Document Script  button.\nThe metadata to provide is the same as in any Phis document, see the  Upload a document  section.\nOnly one document can be added to this field.\nMore documents can be imported together with the dataset through the  Linked Document(s)  field.

Data File . This mandatory field is used by users to upload the dataset from their computer through the  Browse  button.   The dataset added to Phis must respect some file rules :   the file must be a .csv file  the first line of the file is a header, every other additional row matches with a new element characterized by a single agronomical object, a single date and as many variable values as there are variables  in a given row, each items are separated by a single semicolon  ;  the header contains the fields  AgronomicalObjectURI  and  Date , and as many variable alias as there are added variables (see the .csv template that can be downloaded above the  Data File  field)  the agronomical objects are refered to by their respective URI  the date is refered to in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-date) format  variable values are provided as real number, since Phis then stores numbers as  double-precision floating-point value  numerical values decimal separators should be dots  .  but commas  ,  are tolerated  no character strings, \"NA\" included, are tolerated as variable values : if a variable value is unknown, do not write anything (see example below)  no quotes for URIs, dates or variable values   In the following example, the added dataset exhibits information on two objects, one of them (URI1) displaying values for one variable at three different dates, and the other one (URI2) displaying values for two variables at the same dates :  AgronomicalObjectURI;Date;VariableAlias1;VariableAlias2\nURI1;2017-04-01;;5\nURI1;2017-04-15;;10.0\nURI1;2017-04-31;;12.00\nURI2;2017-04-01;3.22;6\nURI2;2017-04-15;4.12;9\nURI2;2017-04-31;5.347687869;10  The URI of the agronomical objects of a given experimentation can be found on the  Agronomical Objects  menu, using search filters, and then downloaded with the  Download Search Result  button (see the  Object types  of this documentation).\nAll variables values of the imported dataset are associated with agronomical objects that must have been previously declared in Phis (see  Importing plots ).  The data file imported in Phis can displays many fields (i.e. number of items in the header), but only the column matching with the expected fields will be kept.\nThe expected fields and their name are provided in the .csv template provide by the  Download Template  link above the  Data File  field.\nHence, users can copy and paste their data in the template file (keeping the header unchanged), or import directly their datasheet as a .csv, after having renamed correctly the fields as described in the template.   In order to finalize the addition of the dataset, click on the bottom  Create  button.   The waiting time following the use of the  Create  button can relatively long, depending on the quantity of variable values added.\nIf an error occurs, the dataset is not added to Phis and an error message is displayed.   Else, the dataset is imported in Phis and a success message is displayed.   At the current stage of Phis development, datasets cannot be modified nor deleted once it has been added to Phis.
