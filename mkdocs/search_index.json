            "text": "Experimental Organization\n\n\nScientific frames\n\n\nScientific experiments generate data, which is the focus the present information system.\nHowever, if only the data produced by experiments is stored, and not the complete experimental conditions, i.e. the environmental conditions, infrastructure and supporting equipment or resources used to conduct those experiments, then such archived data would be orphan and therefore non reusable.\n\n\nThe first element of experimental conditions which is stored in Phis is the scientific frames linked to plant phenotyping experiments.\nA scientific frame can be a national infrastructure, a local infrastructure, or an installation (also refered to as \"platform\" or \"facility\"), as defined at \nemphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu\n and at \nagroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/OEPO\n.\nOEPO is progressively being replaced by the more generic \nOntology of Experimental Scientif Objects (OESO)\n stored in GitHub at \ngithub.com/OpenSILEX/ontology-vocabularies\n.\n\n\nUsers register scientific frames in Phis in order to later enrich metadata associated to experimental data by establishing a link between this data and given scientific frames.\n\n\nThe complete list of scientific frames registered in a Phis session is available in the \nExperimental organization / Scientific frames\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\n\n\nThe \nAdd document\n button at the top of the each scientific frame information sheet remains orange until a first document has been added, e.g. a flyer describing the infrastructure or an organization chart.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on documents.\n\n\nIt is from this \nScientific frames\n menu that the installation manager can add the template documents for UAV or Phenomobile acquisition sessions.\nHe has to go to the information sheet of the concerned scientific frame. Then he has to click on the \nAdd document\n button and then select the \nDocument type\n \nAcquisitionSessionUAVDocument\n or \nAcquisitionSessionPhenomobileDocument\n depending on which type of template document is created.\nThose template documents will then be accessible from the \nAcquisition session template\n item from the \nInstallations\n menu in the top bar.\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nWhat are projects ?\n\n\nA research project is the higher level of organisation in Phis.\nIt is generally the object of a contract or a grant agreement between the laboratory performing the research activities and funding agencies providing the financial support.\nA project can hold many experiments from various experimental campaigns.\nBesides, several projects can participate to the same experimentation.\n\n\nWhat are project properties ?\n\n\nProjects fact sheets are all public, i.e. visible for every Phis user, including those unrelated to them.\nHowever, experimental data included in a project is also necessarily related to a given experiment.\nThis data is accessible only to users who belong to a group (either owner or guest) authorized to access the experimentation it is related to: access rights are managed by experiment and not by project.\nPlease see the \nRestrictions to a group\n section of this documentation for further details on data access matters.\n\n\nThe complete list of projects is available in the \nExperimental organization / Projects\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nThe projects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter projects by their acronym, their main source of funding, and their start and end dates.\nThere's no need to use the same case as the expected results: a lowercase search returns every results matching the characters, disregarding whether those match are lowercase or uppercase.\nFurther information on a given project is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the projects list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.\n\n\n\n\nA project information sheet displays all this project information stored in Phis: URI, acronyme, objective, start and end dates, contacts linked to the project, a description, etc.\nDocuments (PDF, tables, etc.) can also be linked to a project.\nAt the top of the project information sheet lie three buttons allowing the user to interact with the selected project.\n\n\n\n\nThe project specifics, displayed in the information sheet, can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button.\n\n\nAnother top button is the \nAdd document\n button which remains orange until a first document has been added.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on Phis documents and for learning how to insert them in the information system.\n\n\nThe \nAdd annotation\n button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected project using the \nWeb Annotation Data Model\n (oa).\nSee the \nAnnotation\n section below for further information on annotations within Phis.\n\n\nCreate a project\n\n\nWithin the \nProjects\n menu, one can create a new project with the\n\nCreate Project\n button.\n\n\nTool tips are provided for most fields: they appear on the left hand side when one drags the pointer on those fields.\n\n\n\n\nThe mandatory fields, followed by a red asterisk, are:\n\n\n\n\nacronyme\n\n\nname\n\n\ndate (start / end)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is highly recommended to fill every field. If possible, fields requiring plain text (keywords, description) should be answered to in English.\n\n\nURI\n. The project URI is automatically created using the acronym provided by the user.\nThe URI creation respects the \nw3 recommandations\n.\n\n\nAcronym\n. Short and meaningful, the acronym will be the preferred way to refer to the created project.\nThe acronym provided here is usually the one of the research project.\nA project acronym cannot include spaces.\nOnce the project created, its acronym can no longer be modified.\n\n\nName\n. Full name of the project, it will seldom be refered to but allows a project creator to explicit the acronym. For instance, \nRAPeSeed Oil content anD Yield under low Nitrogen input\n would be an adequate name for the project whose acronym is \nRAPSODYN\n.\n\n\nSubproject Of\n. If the new project is part of an existing project (requisitly known to Phis), one can select the name of the given mother-project within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new project is created.\n\n\nSubproject Type\n. The subproject type can optionnaly be provided. It can be either an existing type to be selected from the list of proposed project types, either a new type provided by the user. In the later case, one has to type the new subproject type (e.g. \nphd thesis\n or \ninternship\n) in the search field of \nSubproject Type\n and then click on the newly proposed type.\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n. A short synthesis of the project objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the \nDescription\n field.\n\n\nFinancial Support\n. Organism, institution or funding agency providing the financial support of the research project. Only one organism supporting financially the project can be cited for now. Same as the \nSubproject Type\n field, the answer can be both from a predefined list or a new one (the user has to type the new organism name and then click on the search result matching the organism name).\n\n\nFinancial Name\n. As indicated in the tool tip, this field is meant for the user to provide the identification of the financial support document (e.g. a grant agreement number).\n\n\nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n are to be provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day), directly or through the calendar view.\nIf the end date of the project is unknown, the start date can be used also as \nDate End\n temporarily.\n\n\nScientific Contacts\n. Email adresses of the scientists involved in the project.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\nIf unavailable in the predefined list, emails can be added to Phis from the \nPersons\n menu, prior to the new project creation. Please see the \nPersons\n section of this documentation for further details.\n\n\nAdministrative Contacts\n. Email adresses of the administrative personnel linked to the project (e.g. human ressources people).\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nProject Coordinators\n. Email adresses of the project coordinators.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nWebsite\n. If available, URL of the website of the project.\n\n\nKeywords\n.

Complete plain text description of the project, preferably provided in English language. Additionally to the description, additional information can be provided as uploaded files, after the project has been created.\n\n\nExperiments\n\n\nWhat are experiments ?\n\n\nField plant phenotyping experimentations are refered to in Phis as \nExperiments\n.\nExperiments in Phis form self-sustained organizational units occuring in a delimited and known time frame.\nEvery scientific objects and environmental data stored in Phis field have to be related to an experiment.\nExperiments include both raw and cleaned data.\nThe data types found in Phis experiments are including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nphenotypic data\n\n\nenvironmental data\n\n\nanalysis, workflows and their associated results\n\n\ndocuments giving a deeper understanding of the experiments\n\n\n\n\nWhat are experiment properties ?\n\n\nContrary to projects, experiments information sheets are not public, but accessible only to the Phis members which are part of the groups involved in these experiments.\nPlease go to \nAccess rights\n for further details on this matter.\n\n\nFrom the \nExperiments\n menu, a Phis user has access to the list of experiments it has the rights to access to.\nEvery experiment on this list is characterized by:\n\n\n\n\nits \nURI\n which identies it uniquely\n\n\nits \nAlias\n, a short internal denomination\n\n\nits stat and end dates\n\n\nthe experimental installation in which is has been performed\n\n\nthe campaign it is part of, i.e. the year\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nHome / Experiments\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see a given experiment information sheet.\n\n\n\n\nFurther information on the experiment is provided on its information sheet, such as the groups of users that have been given access to the experiment's data.\nFor more detail on experimental data access restrictions, see the section \nRestrictions to a group\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of the experiment information sheet, several buttons are displayed.\nThe button \nMap Visualization\n enables the visualization of the scientific objects (e.g. plots) of the experiment on a map centered on the experiment intallation location.\nJump to the section \nMap Visualization\n for more information on experiment maps.\nThe use of the other buttons, \nUpdate\n and \nAdd document\n, is described at the end of the next section entitled \nCreate an experiment\n.\nThe \nAdd annotation\n button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected experiment using the \nWeb Annotation Data Model\n (oa).\nSee the \nAnnotation\n section below for further information on annotations within Phis.\n\n\nCreate an experiment\n\n\nWithin the \nExperiments\n menu, a Phis user can create a new experiment with the\n\nCreate Experiment\n button.\n\n\nTool tips are provided for some fields: they appear on the left hand side when one drags the pointer on those fields.\n\n\nThe mandatory fields, followed by an asterisk, are:\n\n\n\n\nprojects\n\n\ndate (start / end)\n\n\ncampaign\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is highly recommended to fill every field. If possible, fields requiring plain text (keywords, description) should be answered to in English.\n\n\nURI\n. The project URI is automatically created by Phis web service which uses the acronym of the Phis instance from where the experiment is created (e.g. \nDIA\n for Diaphen) and the \ncampaign\n provided by the user (e.g. \n2018\n).\n\n\nAlias\n. Internal name of the experiment, usually provided in all caps.\n\n\nProjects\n. Name of the project(s) the new experiment is part of.\nA single experiment can be linked to several projects.\nOne can select the name of the given projects only within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new experiment is created.\n\n\nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n are to be provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day), directly or through the calendar view.\nIt it compulsory to give a value to the \nDate End\n field in order to create an experiment.\nIf the end date of the experiment is unknown, the start date can be reused in the \nDate End\n field.\nTypical \nDate Start\n values correspond to a sowing date, while \nDate End\n typically concur with an harvesting date.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n. Name or ID of the installation where the experiment is carried.\nNo specific format is yet required for submitting an installation name. \ntodo\n.\n\n\nCampaign\n. Year (format YYYY) in which the experiment has been carried, or the year of the harvest/end of the experiment in case it has been carried on several years (\nto be confirmed\n).\nOnce the experiment created, the information on the campaign in which it has been carried can no longer be modified.\n\n\n\n\nPlace\n. Locality or town name used internally to situate the installation location.\nThis field will later be removed in the upcoming developments of Phis.\n\n\nScientific supervisors\n. Email adresses of the experiment supervisor(s).\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\nIf unavailable in the predefined list, emails can be added to Phis from the \nPersons\n menu, prior to the new project creation. Please see the \nPersons\n section of this documentation for further details.\n\n\nTechnical supervisors\n. Email adresses of the technicians and scientists (including phd students, interns, etc.) involved in the experiment implementation.\nThe email adresses refer uniquely to persons existing on Phis.\n\n\nCrop Species\n. Common name of the crop species which are the object of the experiment.\nEach crop species names must be separated by a comm.\nPreferably provided in English, without any capital letters.\nA link to the internal ontology is under development.\n\n\nGroups\n. List of the Phis users groups authorized to access the new experiment.\nThis field is crucial when creating an experiment.\nOnly a Phis user belonging to at least one of the groups specified in this field will be authorized to access the newly created experiment.\nAn experiment assigned to no group is by default set as public.\nPlease go to \nAccess rights\n for further details on this matter.\n\n\nObjective\n. A short synthesis of the experiemnt objectives is to be provided in plain text, preferably in English. A more complete description will be asked in the \nComment\n field.\n\n\nKeywords\n. Keywords characterizing the experiment. Each keyword, should be separated by a comma and not include any capital letter, e.g. \nnitrogen use efficiency, rapeseed\n.\n\n\nComment\n. Complete plain text description of the experiment, preferably provided in English language. Additionally to the description, detailed knowledge on the experimentation can be provided through uploaded files, but only after the experiment has been created.\n\n\nCompleting the experiment creation within Phis is then achieved by clicking on the \nCreate\n button.\n\n\nFrom \nHome / Experiments\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see the newly created experiment information sheet.\n\n\nThe \nAdd document\n button at the top of the experiment information sheet remains orange until a first document has been added, e.g. an experimental design.\nSee the \nDocuments\n section below for further information on documents.\n\n\nOnce created, the experiment specifics can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button.\n\n\nLinking sensors and variables to an experiments\n\n\nAdmin users can associate experiments to variables and sensors, but only if they have already been declared in the system through to the \nVariables\n menu and the \nSensors\n menu respectively.\n\n\nAn experiment can be linked to several variables and sensors previously declared in Phis.\n\n\nFrom the \nExperiments\n menu (accessible from the \nexperimental organization\n menu in the top navigation bar), select an experiment from the experiments list clicking on the eye icon on its right to access its information sheet.\nThen, go to the \nMeasured Variables\n field and add variables from the dropdown list displaying all the alias of the variables previously declared in Phis.\nYou can also go to the \nSensors which participates in\n field and add sensors from the dropdown list displaying all the alias of the sensors previously declared in Phis.\n\n\nAfter having selected one or several variables or sensors, click on the \nUpdate measured variable\n button (check symbol) on the right to save the changes you made to the experiment.\nYou should get a green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the \nUpdate measured variable\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe experiment-variable and experiment-sensor links are now saved in the triplestore and displayed respectively in the \nMeasured Variables\n and \nSensors which participates in\n fields of the experiment information sheet.\nTo remove these links, just click on the close window symbol (\"x\") next to the variable or sensor alias in their respective fields, and then click on the associated \nUpdate measured variable\n button.\nYou should get another green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the \nUpdate measured variable\n button, which confirms the changes made.\n\n\nMap visualization\n\n\nObjects selection\n\n\nScientific objects associated with a given experiment, for example plots, can be displayed on a map, thanks to their geopositioning informations.\nIn Phis, a map refers to a dynamic map where all the scientific objects of a given experiment are represented.\n\n\nAfter having imported scientific objects linked to an experiment, a map associated with this experiment can be visualized within the \nExperiments\n menu through the \nMap Visualization\n button.\n\n\nFrom this \nMap Visualization\n menu, one can create and subsequently update its information (if new scientific objects have been linked to the experiment) through the \nGenerate Map\n button on the top right corner of the web page.\nOnce the map of an experiment has been created, there's no need to re-create it if no new scientific object (e.g. plot) has been linked to this experiment.\n\n\nThe map of an experiment is dynamic: one can zoom in and out with the \n+\n and \n-\n sign at the top left corner of the map, or simply using the mouse wheel.\nThe map visualization also works with a touchscreen.\nMap rotation is performed pressing \nAlt + Shift\n while draging the mouse pointer.\nSelecting multiple contiguous scientific objects is performed pressing \nCtrl + Left Click\n and then dragging the mouse pointer (still holding the mouse left click).\nSelecting multiple non-contiguous scientific objects is performed pressing \nCtrl + Shift\n and then using the left-click of the mouse pointer.\n\n\n\n\nWhen scientific objects of a map are selected, their attributes (alias within the experiment, crop species, variety, modality, replication) are displayed in a table under the map.\n\n\n\n\nGraphics from datasets\n\n\nAnother feature provided by the \nMap Visualization\n menu is the possibility to plot graphics from datasets associated to an experiment.\nA first step is to select on the map scientific objects (e.g. plots) as explained \nabove\n.\nIn order to order to create clear graphics,one should avoid selecting too many objects at the same time.\nAt that point, a new section, \nDataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))\n, appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\nThe second step is to select the variable of the dataset from which a graphic should be produced.\nAn optionnal filter for the graphic creation enables the user to use only data from a specific time window to produce the desired graphic.\n\n\nQuantitative Variable\n. Mandatory field. Here is selected a variable of interest from a predefined list of all the variables defined in a given Phis instance.\nVariables can be selected only one at a time.\nIf the selected variable is associated to no dataset linked to the present experiment, then no graphic is plotted.\nIn the next Phis developments, variables associated a gien project or experimentation will be declared at the level of the project/experimentation.\n\n\nDate Start\n. Optionnal. First date from which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a previous date will not appear in the graphic.\n\n\nDate End\n. Optionnal. Last date at which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a later date will not appear in the graphic.\n\n\nThe last step is to press the \nSearch\n button, which will lead to the creation of a graphic displaying according to a time axis the variable values associated to:\n\n\n\n\nthe scientific objects selected on the map\n\n\nthe variable selected in the \nQuantitative Variable\n field\n\n\npotentially the time window between \nDate Start\n and \nDate End\n if those fields have been filled out\n\n\n\n\nOn the new graphic, the time is displayed on the abscissa axis and the variable on the ordinate axis.\nEach points of the same color are associated to the same scientific object which is identified below the graphic by its URI.\nIn future Phis developments, objects alias instead of URIs will be used as curve labels.\nVariable values and curve associated to an scientific object can be masked by clicking on its associated curve label which at this point changes from black to grey.\nClicking a second time on the label as the effect to show again the previously hidden curve.\n\n\nImages\n\n\nAnother feature provided by the \nMap Visualization\n menu is the possibility to show images associated to an experiment, such as hemispherical images shot on the field.\n\n\nA first step is to select on the map the scientific object (e.g. plot), as explained \nabove\n, associated with the images you want to visualize.\nDo not select two scientific objects (or more), otherwise PHIS would look for images associated to both the selected object, while most images are associated to one and only one object.\nAt that point, a new section, \nImages Visualization (On selected plot)\n, appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is to select the type of image you want to display, selecting it from the list of images type, and then press the \nShow Images\n button.\n\n\nDocuments\n\n\nWhat are Phis documents ?\n\n\nIn order to ease the comprehension of projects and experiments, it is possible to upload various documents to Phis and connect them to resources such as infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors or vectors declared in Phis.\n\n\nDocuments that could help persons understand a project are typically a (reasearch) contract, a phd (or master) thesis, or various multimedia content such as photos or beamer presentations.\nSimilarly, one could expect knowledge about an experimentation to be provided through documents that could be protocols, experimental designs, technical or scientific files, data files, research papers, etc.\nExamples of document formats are PDF, txt, csv, png images, etc.\nHowever, large files are not yet supported by Phis: a document uploaded to Phis cannot exceed 2MB for now.\n\n\nThe documents uploaded to Phis through the \nDocuments\n section are meant for human consultation.\nHowever, metadata (intelligible to machines) must be provided for every new document.\nThese metadata contain the document properties:\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\ncreator\n\n\nlanguage\n\n\ncreation date\n\n\ndocument type\n\n\n\n\nInformation of a document can later be changed, while the document itself cannot be modified.\n\n\nMetadata are specified with \nDublin Core\n recommendations.\nMetadata enables the documents to be stored in the Phis triplestore.\nThe expression of Dublin Core metadata using the Resource Description Framework is described at \ndublincore.org\n.\n\n\nUpload a document\n\n\nAny Phis user can upload a new document and specify its metadata with the \nCreate Document\n button displayed on top of the information sheet of any element prone to be enriched with documents (infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors and vectors).\n\n\nNo admin rights are required from a Phis user to add a new document.\n\n\nTitle\n. Title of the uploaded document.\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.\nA document title does not have to match the name of the uploaded file it is imported from.\n\n\nCreator\n. Name(s) of the document creator(s), separated by commas\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.\n\n\nLanguage\n. Language in which the document is provided.\nIn accordance to the \nDublin Core Element Set v1.1\n document, the value of the language element is defined by \nRFC 1766\n which includes a two-character language code taken from the \nISO639\n standard.\nThe language code should be provided in lower case (e.g. \nfr\n for French, \nen\n for English, etc.).\n\n\nCreation Date\n. Date of the document creation.\nIf unknown, the current date (i.e. the date at the moment of the document upload into Phis) can be used.\n\n\nConcerned Projects\n. Project(s) for which the document is relevant.\nOne can select the name of the given project(s) only within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new document is uploaded.\n\n\nConcerned Experimentation\n. Experiment(s) for which the new document is relevant.\nA Phis user can select the name of the given experiment(s) only within the exhaustive list of experiments it has access to.\n\n\nDocument Type\n.

Complete plain text description of the new document, preferably provided in English language.\nFor now, line breaks cannot be inserted in a comment: they could generate a bug.\n\n\nClick on the \nCreate\n button to complete the document creation, i.e. the document upload and the specification of its metadata with \nDublin Core\n standards.\n\n\nThe list of documents a given user has access to is avaible from the navigation bar through the \nTools > Documents\n menu.\nFrom \nHome / Documents\n, one can click on the eye icon on the right to see a given document information sheet (metadata).\nFrom there, the document cannot be modified or deleted (in Phis current version).\nHowever, the document metadata can be modified with the \nUpdate\n button on top of the information sheet.\nThe document can also be downloaded clicking on the \n icon above the \nView / Download\n text, below the information sheet.\n\n\n\n\nScientific Objects\n\n\nObject types\n\n\nPlant phenotyping experiments all revolve around one entity of interest: plants !\nHowever, plants can be studied at various scales, from a single leaf to a field.\nPhis experiments register data on elementary units: \nscientific objects\n (also refered to as agronomical objects), which are no more than declinations of plants, at various scales:\n\n\n\n\nplant organ\n: part of a given plant (e.g. \nrootstock\n, \nscion\n, \nsilk\n, \nseed\n)\n\n\nplant\n: single individual, displaying a single genotype (which is refered to as a \nvariety\n). Most common elementary unit of greenhouse experiments.\n\n\nplot\n: smallest spatial unit, a.k.a micro-plot (one treatment maximum can be applied on a plot). Most common elementary unit of field experiments.\n<!--\n\n\nblock\n: combination of plots, generally forming an environmentally homogeneous entity\n\n\nfield\n: large spatial unit that includes plots and potentially blocks\n-->\n\n\n\n\nThese scientific objects, forming the basic units of experimentations, are observed through time, and consequently constitute the origin of phenotypic data.\n\n\nA given scientific object is required to be associated with one experiment, and one only.\nPhis development team is aware of the challenge in declaring perennial plants studied over several years. One might want to declare it in various experiments, each experiment matching a different time-period.\nPhis development team is open for discussion on this matter with its user.\n\n\nPhenotypic data created in an experiment, whether it is directly measured, calculated or estimated, is necessarily linked to scientific objects.\n\n\nEvery scientific object is uniquely identified through a standardized URI which is automatically assigned by Phis when it is first entered in the system by a user.\nMetadata is associated to objects under the form of attributes: the object alias, its type (plant, plot, etc.), the experiment it is part of, etc.\nData associated with these objects consists of the values of phenotypic variables (declared in Phis through the \nVariables menu\n) linked to these objects during the \nData import process\n.\n\n\nThe complete list of scientific objects declared in Phis is available in the \nScientific Objects\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nPhis users with a restricted access (e.g. \nguest\n) are likely to be unable to see the \nScientific Objects\n menu, since there are no objects for them to see.\nThe scientific objects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter objects by their URI, Alias, type and the experience they are linked to.\nThe scientific objects list also displays additional properties (the objects species, variety, etc.).\nThe list of objects associated with a search result, and their metadata, can be retrieved as a .csv file with the \nDownload Search Result\n button.\n\n\n\n\nScientific objects information can also be accessed through the \nExperiments\n menu.\nAfter having selected an experiment, the scientific objects linked to it can be displayed on a map.\nMoreover, selecting objects on such a map provides additional information on the attributes of these objects.\nSee the \nMap Visualization\n section for more information on that matter.\n\n\nImporting scientific objects\n\n\nWithin the \nScientific Objects\n menu, Phis users can import new plots with the\n\nCreate\n button.\n\n\nScientific objects such as plots are imported into Phis through an editable table in which each row contains the information of an additionnal scientifc object to be inserted in Phis database.\n\n\nOne can also copy and paste in this table the content of a .csv file whose header is:\n\n\nAlias;Type;Experiment;Geometry;Parent;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Replication\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the content of this table, column by column:\n\n\nGenerated URI\n. Field to leave blank. Every new scientific object will be automatically assigned an URI when declared in Phis.\n\n\nAlias\n. Internal name of the scientific object (free text).\nIn a given experiment, there can not be two identical aliases.\n\n\nType\n. Type of the scientific object, chosen from a closed list containing:\n\n\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nPlant\n\n\nLeaf\n\n\nRootstock\n\n\nSeed\n\n\nScion\n\n\nSilk\n\n\nScientificObject (generic term, it is not recommended to use it)\n\n\n\n\nThere is only a handful of proposed scientific object types in the current ontology: do not hesitate to contact OpenSILEX development team to add object types that cannot be found in the list in order to make it evolve.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.\n\n\nExperiment\n. URI of the experiment the declared scientific objects belong to.\nIf this field is not filled excusively with URIs of experiments stored in Phis, then no scientific object will be added to the system.\nThe experiments URIs can be selected from a dropdown list displaying all experiments declared in the system.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.\nNote that as described in the \nModifying scientific objects\n section, it is possible to link a scientific object to several experiments in two steps. From the \nScientific Objects\n menu :\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \nCreate\n button, create scientific objects with a given experiment URI in the \nExperiment\n column\n\n\nUsing the \nUpdate\n button, copy and paste the table used in the scientific object creation, and then replace the value of the \nExperiment\n column with another experiment URI\n\n\nRepeat the step 2 everytime you want to associate the same scientific objects to another experiment\n\n\n\n\nGeometry\n. Optionnal. Vector geometry such as polygons (for plots), provided according to \nWell-known text standard\n).\nGeometry coordinates are formatted in \nWGS84\n, also known as the \nEPSG4326\n geodetic coordinate system.\nMore information on this system \nhere\n.\nA quick way to draw WKT polygons from a map is to use the \"draw a shape\" tool of the \nsandbox\n website.\nHowever, it is recommended to use professional geographic information systems such as \nQGis\n.\n\n\nParent\n. Optionnal. URI of the parent scientific object, for example the URI of a previously declared plot when declaring in the system a plant that has been harvested from this plot.\nAnother example is a plant URI which can be used as a parent of a plant organ being declared.\n\n\nSpecies\n. Optionnal. The URI of the species of a plant, a plant part or plot (free text).\nThe Species URIs can be selected from a dropdown list displaying all species URIs declared in the system.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.\nThe complete list of species found in Phis is displayed in the  \nExperimental organization / Species\n menu, described in the \nSpecies\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nVariety\n. Optionnal. The variety of a plant or a plant part or the variety of a plot (free text).\n\n\nAdditional scienfic object properties that can be declared through the web services but not through the web client:\n\n\nExperimentModalities\n. The experiment modality of the plot, no controlled vocabulary required so far (e.g. \"WD\" for water deficit). (free text).\n\n\nReplication\n. The repetition of the scientific object mostly used for plots (e.g. 1, 2, A, or B...). (free text).\n\n\nInsertion status\n. Automatically filled when clicking on the \nCreate Scientific Objects\n button : this indicator shows which new scientific objects have been created and which one have failed to be added to the system.\n\n\nEvery other additional line matches with a new scientific object.\n\n\nLet's take into consideration a fictionnal experiment composed of 4 plots of the same crop (\"Species\").\nIn half of the plot, the variety \"A\" of the studied crop is grown, and in the other half, the variety \"B\".\nOf two plots dispaying the same variety, one is submitted to an experiment modality labelled \"treatment 1\", while the other is submitted to a \"treatment 2\".\nExperiments and Species have to be expressed with their internal Phis URI.\nThis configuration is sum up in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlias\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nExperimentURI\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nVariety\n\n\nExperimentModalities\n\n\nReplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot1\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyA\n\n\nTreatment1\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot2\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyA\n\n\nTreatment2\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot3\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyB\n\n\nTreatment1\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot4\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nURI Experiment X\n\n\nURI Species Y\n\n\nvarietyB\n\n\nTreatment2\n\n\nRep1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file necessary to import those four plots is a 5 line csv file: after the header, every line of the imported file needs to display the 7 required elements, for instance separated by semicolons (or commas):\n\n\nAlias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Replication\nplot1;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot2;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment2;Rep1\nplot3;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot4;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment2;Rep1\n\n\n\n\nSuch a file can be then copied and pasted to the handsontable form.\n\n\nA single scientific object cannot correspond to several species, variety, experimental modality or replication.\nOn the contrary, the same species, variety, experimental modality or replication can be used for several scientific objects.\n\n\nSome scientific object type such as plots can be described by geometrical objects such as polygons, whose GPS coordinates are provided following the \nWell-known text standard\n).\n\n\nThe first step in order to import scientific object is usually to create a .csv file containing all the new plots information, as is reminded below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlias\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nExperimentURI\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nVariety\n\n\nExperimentModalities\n\n\nReplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpX_modY_plotZ\n\n\nPOLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))\n\n\nhttp://www.phenome-fppn.fr/.../...\n\n\nhttp://www.phenome-fppn.fr/id/species/...\n\n\ne.g. varietyX\n\n\ne.g. nitrogen-1\n\n\ne.g. 1 (or A-I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is to copy and paste the content of the CSV file in the handsontable form displayed in the \nHome / Scientific Objects / Create Scientific Object\n menu and then click on the \nCreate Scientific Objects\n bottom button to complete the declaration of scientific objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying scientific objects\n\n\nWithin the \nScientific Objects\n menu, Phis users can modify the properties of existing scientific objects with the \nUpdate\n button.\n\n\nScientific objects such as plots are modified through an editable table in which each row contains the information of an additionnal scientifc object to be modified in Phis database.\n\n\nEven if you want to change the value of only one property of an experimental object (i.e. its experimental modality), you need to provide in the handsontable all of its former properties that you want to keep (e.g. type, species, etc.), otherwise this information will be lost.\n\n\nIt is not possible to change the experiment to which a scientific object participates, however it is possible to state that a scientific object participates in various experiments.\nIn order to assign scientific objects to two experiments, one has to create those scientific objects through the \nCreate\n button of the \nHome / Scientific Objects\n menu, assigning them to a first experiment, and then submit the same table through the \nUpdate\n button, with the exception of the \"ExperimentURI\" field which will display of URI of the other experiment the new scientific objects belong to.\n\n\nVisualize scientific objects\n\n\nSee \nMap Visualization\n section.\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nThe complete list of species registered in a Phis session is available in the \nExperimental organization / Species\n menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\n\n\nThis list comes handy when declaring the species a scientific object belongs to. Instead of using free text when specifing a species, we choose between the available species URI.\nThis procedure prevents the use of various names for the same entity, e.g. \ntriticum aestivum\n and \nbread wheat\n.\n\n\nThere is only a handful of proposed species in the current ontology: do not hesitate to contact OpenSILEX development team to add species that cannot be found in the list in order to make it evolve.\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nVariables properties\n\n\nPhis variables characterize Phis \nscientific objects\n or their \nenvironment\n.\nVariables characterizing scientific objects are \nphenotypic variables\n, while variables characterizing the environment in which those scientific objects are studied are refered to as \nenvironmental variables\n.\nPhis variables can be either directly mesured by a sensor, either computed from one or several variables.\n\n\nEvery variable produced by an experiment must have been previously created in Phis, and every variable created in Phis has to be defined unambuigusously.\nConsequently, when a user refers to a variable in an experiment, there is no ambiguity about the concept he is refering to.\nMoreover, the usage of unequivocal variables in experiments is a necessary step towards a more intelligible, reliable and reproducible Science.\n\n\nPhis variables are listed in the \nVariables\n menu.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g. \nguestphis\n) is likely to be unable to see the \nVariables\n menu, since there is no variable for her/him to see.\n\n\nVariable definition is based on the \nCrop Ontology guidelines (draft document)\n.\nTherefore, Phis variables are all unequivocally characterized by the following triplet:\n\n\n\n\na single \ntrait\n, either a phenotypic trait or an environmental feature, which is the subject of the new variable\n\n\na single \nmethod\n of measurement or computation of the trait\n\n\na single \nunit\n in which is expressed the value of the trait\n\n\n\n\nFurther information on a given variable is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the variables list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.\n\n\n\n\nA variable information sheet provides knowledge on this variable, but also on the three elements that define it, namely the \ntrait\n, \nmethod\n and \nunit\n related to this variable.\nThe variable and those three defining features all display a \nlabel\n, that should be meaningful and unique, but does not have to be so, an \nURI\n which is however unique, a \nDefinition\n (or \nComment\n) meant for human comprehension, and \nrelated references\n meant for Semantic Web applications.\nReference to external ontologies is achieved through \nSKOS\n standards\n\n\nNB: for now, only phenotypic variables are present\n\n\nCreate variables, traits, methods and units\n\n\nEvery variable found on Phis has been previously created by a Phis user.\nWithin the \nVariables\n menu, one can create a new project with the\n\nCreate Variable\n button.\n\n\nVariable label\n. This field is automatically produced with the concatenation of the trait, method and unit labels, separated by underscores.\nThe resulting variable label is not necessarily unique, but it would be better if it was.\nOn the contrary, the automatically generated URI (not shown in the \nCreate Variable\n menu) is unique.\n\n\nTrait\n. If the trait associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the \nTrait label\n field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nTrait label\n field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a new trait, do not fill the \nTrait label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new trait label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other trait labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided since trait, method and unit labels are concatenated to generate the new variable name with the format \nTrait_Method_Unit\n.\n\n\nA \nComment\n should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the trait specifics as clearly as possible.\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n. If the method associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the \nMethod label\n field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nMethod label\n field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of a new method, do not fill the \nMethod label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new method label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other method labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.\n\n\nA \nComment\n should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the method specifics as clearly as possible.\n\n\nUnit\n. If the unit associated to the new variable cannot be found on the \nUnit label\n predefined list, a new unit has to be created.\nThis can be achieved by clicking on the \n+\n green icon on the right-hand side of the \nUnit label\n field.\nIn the case of a new unit, do not fill the \nUnit label\n field but the \nInternal label\n one, below the \n-\n red icon that replaced the \n+\n green icon.\nThis new unit label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other unit labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.\n\n\nOtherwise, if the appropriate unit is already register in Phis, then one only has to select it from the \nUnit label\n field, without clicking on the \n+\n green icon (or clicking on the \n-\n red icon if the \n+\n green icon had previously been clicked on).\n\n\nIn the tricky case of a variable presenting no unit (e.g. pH), it is advised to crete a new unit whose label would be: dimensionless_unit_\nvariable-name\n (e.g. dimensionless_unit_pH).\nIt matters in order not to use the same \"unit\" for every variable displaying a dimensionless unit.\nMore on this topic on the \nontobee.org\n website.\n\n\n\n\nRelated References\n.\nIn order to unambiguously define the new variable, semantic relations are established by the user between the new variable and concepts already defined in reliable ontologies existing on the world wide web.\nThese relations to external ontologies are established using \nSKOS\n (Simple Knowledge Organization System).\n\n\nEntity\n refers to the Phis entity that will be associated to a concept found in an ontology.\nThis \nEntity\n be either the new variable, trait, method or unit.\nIt is not required to specify related concepts for traits, methods and units, however it is recommanded.\n\n\nRelation\n refers to the nature of the relation between the entity and the concept defined in an ontology.\nThis semantic relation is provided using SKOS.\nThe entity can either be, compared to an ontology concept, an \nexact match\n, a \nclose match\n, \nnarrower\n or \nbroader\n.\n\n\nSKOS mapping properties, \nskos:closeMatch\n and \nskos:exactMatch\n, are used to state alignement links between SKOS concepts, as indicated in the \nw3 SKOS Mapping properties web page\n:\n\n\n\n\nexactMatch\n: used to link two concepts, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications. \nskos:exactMatch\n is a transitive property, and is a sub-property of \nskos:closeMatch\n. \nExample: \n<MyNewNDVIVariable> skos:exactMatch <CO_322:0000880>\n asserts that the variable 'MyNewNDVIVariable' created in Phis refers to the exact same concept as does the variable 'NDVI_M_idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000880'\n\n\ncloseMatch\n: used to link two concepts that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid the possibility of \"compound errors\" when combining mappings across more than two concept schemes, \nskos:closeMatch\n is not declared to be a transitive property. \nExample: \n<MyNewLAIVariable> skos:closeMatch <http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_321:0001254>\n asserts that the variable 'MyNewLAIVariable' created in Phis is very similar to the variable 'LAI_Calc_Idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_321:0001254'\n\n\n\n\nSKOS hierarchical properties \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are used to assert a direct hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts, as indicated in the \nw3 Semantic Relations web page\n:\n\n\n\n\nbroader\n (label=\nhas broader\n): a triple \n<A> skos:broader <B>\n asserts that \n<B>\n, the object of the triple, is a broader concept than \n<A>\n, the subject of the triple. \nExample: \n<MyNewPlantHeightTrait> skos:broader <CO_322:0000994>\n asserts that the trait 'MyNewPlantHeightTrait' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a broader one: which is the concept refered to by the trait 'Plant height' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000994'\n\n\nnarrower\n (label=\nhas narrower\n):  a triple \n<C> skos:narrower <D>\n asserts that \n<D>\n, the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than \n<C>\n, the subject of the triple. \nskos:broader\n is \nowl:inverseOf\n the property \nskos:narrower\n.  \nExample: \n<MyNewStageEstimationMethod> skos:narrower <http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/>\n asserts that the method 'MyNewStageEstimationMethod' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a narrower one, which is the concept refered to by the method 'Silking date - Estimation' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/'\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are only used to assert a direct (i.e., immediate) hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. This provides applications with a convenient and reliable way to access the direct broader and narrower links for any given concept. Note that, to support this usage convention, the properties \nskos:broader\n and \nskos:narrower\n are not declared as transitive properties.\n\n\nReference URI\n refers to the URI of the concept found on ontologies such as the ones suggested in the short list above the \nRelated References\n field.\nThe URI provided here is not necessarily the URL of the web page of the ontology on which the targeted concept is defined.\nIndeed, the URI of a given concept does not necessarily match with the URL of the web page where this concept has been found.\n\nExample: http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nWARNING: using the identifier (e.g. CO_322:0000907) is not sufficient.\n\n\nHyperlink\n (optionnal) refers to the URL where are located the related concept whose URI has been provided in the previous field.\n\nExample: http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the hyperlink (URL) associated to the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nIn this example, the URI of the concept is also an URL (a hyperlink), but it is not the case for every ontology.\n\n\nWhen a variable is created, multiple references using SKOS can be stated, using the \n+\n white icon.\n\n\n\n\nWhich portals provide a link towards various ontologies ?\n\n\nThe \nAgroPortal\n project aims to offer a reference ontology repository for agronomy, reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology, as stated on the \nFAO website\n.\nThe scientific outcomes and the experience of the biomdical domain are thus exploited and transposed into the agronomy domain, including plants, food, environment and possibly animal sciences.\n\n\nThe \nEphesis Ontotology Portal\n  is a JavaScript widget displaying all the observation variables of a Breeding API endpoint.\nIt lists ontologies available with the BreedingAPI/CropOntology JSON format.\n\n\nHere are some examples of ontologies:\n\n\nThe \nCrop Ontology (CO)\n current objective is to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of crops, on trait mesurement and methods, as well as on germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms.\n\n\nThe \nPlant Ontology (PO)\n is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology, growth and development to plant genomics data.\nThe URL provided \nhere\n redirects visitors to the Planteome website since PO is developed by the Planteome Project, alongside with other reference ontologies listed in the \nPlanteome Ontologies webpage\n.\nThe \nPlanteome\n project is a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to access plant genomics data.\n\n\nThe \nUnit Ontology\n gathers metrical units for use in conjunction with \nPATO\n (Phenotype And Trait Ontology), which is a phenotypic quality ontology.\n\n\nWhich other ressources, besides ontologies, can I link my variables to ?\n\n\nAGROVOC\n is a controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, etc.\nIt is published by the FAO and edited by a community of experts.\nMore information is provided on the \nFAO website\n.\n\n\nVariable Definition\n. Text defining clearly the concept underlying the new variable.\nThis definition should ideally be provided in English.\n\n\nModifiy existing variables\n\n\nSo far, it is not possible to modify or delete an existing variable, other than by asking a Phis developper.\n\n\nDataset\n\n\nDataset properties\n\n\nThe heart of experiments is to produce datasets associated with the agronomical variables it studies.\nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping platforms commonly set up experiments in which plant growth is monitored.\nPlant growth dynamics are analyzed through the evolution of various variable (e.g. LAI, NDVI, etc.) through time.\n\n\nAt this stage of development, all dataset variables are quantitative.\nNo qualitative variables are saved in the datasets: a variable from a dataset can only assume numerical values and no character string is allowed.\n\n\nA dataset typically displays information on many scientific objects.\nThese objects can be described by several variables.\nEach one of these variables can assume diverse values at different dates.\nIn order to avoid confusion, each element of a dataset should then be understood as a triplet object-time-variable.\nThus, each element of a dataset is associated uniquely with\n\n\n\n\na single scientific object (e.g. a plot)\n\n\na single date (the day of the data acquisition)\n\n\na single variable (a quantitative variable used to monitor the measured or calculated trait)\n\n\na single variable numerical value (the value of the variable cited above)\n\n\n\n\nDatasets are available indirectly through the \nExperiments\n menu, selecting an experiment and then accessing to its map through the \nMap Visualization\n button.\n\n\nGraphics can be extracted from the experiment datasets in the \nDataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))\n section, which appears under the map of the experiment when scientific objects are selected.\nHow to create such graphics is explained in the \nMap Visualization\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nImport Dataset\n\n\nDatasets can be added to Phis through the \nDataset\n menu in the top navigation bar.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g. \nguestphis\n) is likely to be unable to see the \nDataset\n menu.\nIndeed, only users that are part of an owner group are authorized to add datasets to the experiments associated to this group.\nGo to the \nGroups level of access\n section for further information on this issue.\n\n\nWhen adding a dataset to Phis, three types of elements can be created:\n\n\n\n\nthe dataset itself, as a .csv file\n\n\nthe metadata associated to this dataset (e.g. variables in the dataset, creation date, etc.)\n\n\noptionnal documents associated to the dataset\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Variable\n. Mandatory field. Variable or list of the variables found in the added dataset.\nThe variable(s) must have previously been defined in Phis (see \nVariables\n).\n\n\nDataset Creation Date\n. Mandatory field. Date in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format matching to the day in which the imported data has been generated.\nLet's take the example of a drone flight performed two weeks before the data import, followed by the production of clean data from the flight images one week before the import.\nThe imported data is the clean data created one week before the data import.\nTherefore, the date to provide in \nDataset Creation Date\n is the one corresponding to one week before the data import.\nThis field is necessary for provenance purposes.\n\n\nWas generated By\n.\nOptionnal document giving indications on how the data has been created.\nIf a single script (e.g. in R or python language) has been used to create the imported data, it should be uploaded here.\nIf the data creation process has been more complex, a document (e.g. PDF or text) could be provided to describe it.\nThe document import is performed via the \nAdd Document Script\n button.\nThe metadata to provide is the same as in any Phis document, see the \nUpload a document\n section.\nOnly one document can be added to this field.\nMore documents can be imported together with the dataset through the \nLinked Document(s)\n field.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n.  Informative plain text description of how the imported data has been generated, preferably provided in English language.\nFor instance, if the data has been generated with Phenoscript v1.2, one can mention it here, especially if the concerned script cannot be imported.\n\n\nLinked Document(s)\n.\nAdditionnal documents associated with the dataset and imported to Phis.\nClick on the \nAdd Document\n button and then fill out the usual document creation form as described in the \nUpload a document\n section.\nMultiple documents can be uploaded and associated to the imported dataset.\nClick several times on \nAdd Document\n in order to add several documents.\n\n\n\n\nData File\n. This mandatory field is used by users to upload the dataset from their computer through the \nBrowse\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset added to Phis must respect some file rules:\n\n\n\n\nthe file must be a .csv file\n\n\nthe first line of the file is a header, every other additional row matches with a new element characterized by a single scientific object, a single date and as many variable values as there are variables\n\n\nin a given row, each items are separated by a single semicolon \n;\n\n\nthe header contains the fields \nScientificObjectURI\n and \nDate\n, and as many variable alias as there are added variables (see the .csv template that can be downloaded above the \nData File\n field)\n\n\nthe scientific objects are refered to by their respective URI\n\n\nthe date is refered to in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-date) format\n\n\nvariable values are provided as real number, since Phis then stores numbers as \ndouble-precision floating-point value\n\n\nnumerical values decimal separators should be dots \n.\n but commas \n,\n are tolerated\n\n\nno character strings, \"NA\" included, are tolerated as variable values: if a variable value is unknown, do not write anything (see example below)\n\n\nno quotes for URIs, dates or variable values\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the added dataset exhibits information on two objects, one of them (URI1) displaying values for one variable at three different dates, and the other one (URI2) displaying values for two variables at the same dates:\n\n\nScientificObjectURI;Date;VariableAlias1;VariableAlias2\nURI1;2017-04-01;;5\nURI1;2017-04-15;;10.0\nURI1;2017-04-31;;12.00\nURI2;2017-04-01;3.22;6\nURI2;2017-04-15;4.12;9\nURI2;2017-04-31;5.347687869;10\n\n\n\n\nThe URI of the scientific objects of a given experimentation can be found on the \nScientific objects\n menu, using search filters, and then downloaded with the \nDownload Search Result\n button (see the \nObject types\n of this documentation).\nAll variables values of the imported dataset are associated with scientific objects that must have been previously declared in Phis (see \nImporting Scientific Objects\n).\n\n\nThe data file imported in Phis can displays many fields (i.e. number of items in the header), but only the column matching with the expected fields will be kept.\nThe expected fields and their name are provided in the .csv template provide by the \nDownload Template\n link above the \nData File\n field.\nHence, users can copy and paste their data in the template file (keeping the header unchanged), or import directly their datasheet as a .csv, after having renamed correctly the fields as described in the template.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to finalize the addition of the dataset, click on the bottom \nCreate\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe waiting time following the use of the \nCreate\n button can relatively long, depending on the quantity of variable values added.\nIf an error occurs, the dataset is not added to Phis and an error message is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nElse, the dataset is imported in Phis and a success message is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nAt the current stage of Phis development, datasets cannot be modified nor deleted once it has been added to Phis.\n\n\nVisualize Dataset\n\n\nGraphics extracted from Phis datasets are available through the \nExperiments\n menu.\nSee the \nMap Visualization\n section of this documentation for further information.\n\n\nAnnotations\n\n\nWhat are annotations ?\n\n\nAnnotations are comments made on an element of Phis and stored as metadata linked to this element.\nMore broadly, \nthe W3C\n describes annotations as \"typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources\".\nAn annotation can be an explanation given by the creator of a resource, an expert viewpoint or the input of other persons.\nPhis projects, experiments, sensors, vectors, etc. (any element displaying an URI) can be annotated using the W3C specifications of the \nWeb Annotation Data model\n, or \noa\n (prefix of the Web Annotation Data Model, whose namespace is \nhttp://www.w3.org/ns/oa#\n).\nAny user can therefore enrich Phis elements with attached information (metadata) using semantic annotations.\n\n\nAdd annotation\n\n\nAnnotations can be added to Phis through the \nAdd annotation\n button of the information sheet of any project, experiment, sensor or vector.\n\n\nCreator\n. The username of the creator of the annotation (you) is automatically recorded by Phis whenever you create an annotation.\n\n\nMotivated by\n. Following W3C recommendations on \nannotation motivations\n, when creating an annotation you need to select through the controlled vocabulary of \noa\n the motivation category matching the reason why you are creating this annotation:\n\n\n\n\nassessing\n: used when the annotation is a comment or a quality assessment\n\n\nclassifying\n: used when the annotation is an attempt to classify the resource annotated\n\n\nediting\n: used when the annotation is a request to edit or delete a resource\n\n\netc. See \nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose\n for the exhaustive list of annotation motivations\n\n\n\n\nCreation Date\n. Automatically set by Phis using the local time.\n\n\nTargets\n. Automatically set by Phis, this field records the resource (e.g. experiment) from which an annotation creation has been requested by the user (i.e. from which resource he clicked on the \nAdd annotation\n button).\n\n\nDescription\n. Content of the annotation, ideally provided in English (free text).\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nWhat are events ?\n\n\nEvents are crucial pieces of information used to enrich Phis datasets.\nEvents are ponctual occurrences happening during an experiment, and potentially having an impact on the recorded data.\nThose events can be either planned (e.g. a sowing date) or unexpected (e.g. damages to a field experiment caused by wild animals).\n\n\nEvents, like simple annotations, are created following the \nOpen Annotation Data Model\n that allows assigning motivation and purpose attributes to annotations (e.g. oa:describing, oa:identifying, oa:linking, oa: replying, etc.). \nDublin Core\n and \nfoaf\n specifications such as \ndcterms:created\n, \ndcterms:creator\n, \nfoaf:Agent\n are also used.\n\n\nOntology of Experimental Events\n\n\nAn application ontology developped at INRA Montpellier, compliant with the standards of OWL, provides the structured vocabulary necessary to describe all events created and then stored in Phis: it is the Ontology of Experimental Events (OEEv), hosted by \nAgroPortal\n.\nIt can be accessed to from \nagroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/OEEV\n.\n\n\nThe \nOntology of Experimental Events\n, characterises events that occur during an experiment, e.g. dates of sowing, application of a given treatment, harvesting, measurements or sampling for -omic measurements, or any category of technical problem. The OEEv ontology contains four groups of events, namely \nFacility Management\n, \nScientific Object Management\n, \nTrouble\n and \nDisplacement\n.\n\n\nFacility Management\n\n\nThe \nFacility Management\n refers to the set of actions related to the management and maintenance infrastructure and supporting equipment. It describes events related to \nservicing\n, \nmaintenance\n and \ncalibration of equipment or installations\n.\n\n\nScientific Object Management\n\n\nThe \nScientific Object Management\n contains different sub-categories of events related to the typical operations conducted on plants or plots in experiments:\n\n\n\n\nAddingProduct\n refers to the application of products such as fertilizers\n\n\nClipping\n is related to the installation of accessories surch as embeded sensors\n\n\nDetasseling\n refres to removal of the tassel of maize\n\n\nHarvesting\n refers to the harvest of the plant\n\n\nIrrigation\n describes irrgation events\n\n\nThinning\n refers to the removal of some plants, or parts of plants, to make room for the growth of others\n\n\nTreatment\n related to either curative or preventive treatments applied to plants\n\n\nPhenolgyScoring\n refers to the set of events related to the different phenological stages of plants.\n\n\nPotting\n applies to pot experiments\n\n\nSowing\n applies for both field and pot experiments\n\n\nStacking\n refers to the action of putting plant tutors\n\n\n\n\nTrouble\n\n\nThe event \nTrouble\n is defined by three different sub-categories:\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown\n (sensor or conveyor)\n\n\nDysfunction\n (sensor fault, irrigation trouble)\n\n\nIncident\n (a pot falls down, a leaf is blocked in an imaging cabin, lodging of a plot, human error, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nSeveral subtypes of \nincidents\n that often occur in platfortm or field experiments have been declared including:\n\n\n\n\nPotFall\n\n\nLodging\n\n\nStuckPlant\n\n\nPestAttack\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement (object tracking)\n\n\nThe \nDisplacement\n event has been created to follow the position in time and space of the different objects participating in experiments. For instance, plants are often transferred, during a single indoor experiment, between installations or compartments with different environmental conditions. Similarly, sensors can be replaced or moved to different positions in the field or greenhouse. The \nMoveTo\n and \nMoveFrom\n concepts allow tracking objects.",

A research project is the higher level of organisation in Phis.\nIt is generally the object of a contract or a grant agreement between the laboratory performing the research activities and funding agencies providing the financial support.\nA project can hold many experiments from various experimental campaigns.\nBesides, several projects can participate to the same experimentation.  What are project properties ?  Projects fact sheets are all public, i.e. visible for every Phis user, including those unrelated to them.\nHowever, experimental data included in a project is also necessarily related to a given experiment.\nThis data is accessible only to users who belong to a group (either owner or guest) authorized to access the experimentation it is related to: access rights are managed by experiment and not by project.\nPlease see the  Restrictions to a group  section of this documentation for further details on data access matters.

Linking sensors and variables to an experiments  Admin users can associate experiments to variables and sensors, but only if they have already been declared in the system through to the  Variables  menu and the  Sensors  menu respectively.  An experiment can be linked to several variables and sensors previously declared in Phis.  From the  Experiments  menu (accessible from the  experimental organization  menu in the top navigation bar), select an experiment from the experiments list clicking on the eye icon on its right to access its information sheet.\nThen, go to the  Measured Variables  field and add variables from the dropdown list displaying all the alias of the variables previously declared in Phis.\nYou can also go to the  Sensors which participates in  field and add sensors from the dropdown list displaying all the alias of the sensors previously declared in Phis.  After having selected one or several variables or sensors, click on the  Update measured variable  button (check symbol) on the right to save the changes you made to the experiment.\nYou should get a green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the  Update measured variable  button.   The experiment-variable and experiment-sensor links are now saved in the triplestore and displayed respectively in the  Measured Variables  and  Sensors which participates in  fields of the experiment information sheet.\nTo remove these links, just click on the close window symbol (\"x\") next to the variable or sensor alias in their respective fields, and then click on the associated  Update measured variable  button.\nYou should get another green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the  Update measured variable  button, which confirms the changes made.  Map visualization  Objects selection  Scientific objects associated with a given experiment, for example plots, can be displayed on a map, thanks to their geopositioning informations.\nIn Phis, a map refers to a dynamic map where all the scientific objects of a given experiment are represented.  After having imported scientific objects linked to an experiment, a map associated with this experiment can be visualized within the  Experiments  menu through the  Map Visualization  button.  From this  Map Visualization  menu, one can create and subsequently update its information (if new scientific objects have been linked to the experiment) through the  Generate Map  button on the top right corner of the web page.\nOnce the map of an experiment has been created, there's no need to re-create it if no new scientific object (e.g. plot) has been linked to this experiment.  The map of an experiment is dynamic: one can zoom in and out with the  +  and  -  sign at the top left corner of the map, or simply using the mouse wheel.\nThe map visualization also works with a touchscreen.\nMap rotation is performed pressing  Alt + Shift  while draging the mouse pointer.\nSelecting multiple contiguous scientific objects is performed pressing  Ctrl + Left Click  and then dragging the mouse pointer (still holding the mouse left click).\nSelecting multiple non-contiguous scientific objects is performed pressing  Ctrl + Shift  and then using the left-click of the mouse pointer.   When scientific objects of a map are selected, their attributes (alias within the experiment, crop species, variety, modality, replication) are displayed in a table under the map.   Graphics from datasets  Another feature provided by the  Map Visualization  menu is the possibility to plot graphics from datasets associated to an experiment.\nA first step is to select on the map scientific objects (e.g. plots) as explained  above .\nIn order to order to create clear graphics,one should avoid selecting too many objects at the same time.\nAt that point, a new section,  Dataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s)) , appears under the map where the objects have been selected.\nThe second step is to select the variable of the dataset from which a graphic should be produced.\nAn optionnal filter for the graphic creation enables the user to use only data from a specific time window to produce the desired graphic.  Quantitative Variable . Mandatory field. Here is selected a variable of interest from a predefined list of all the variables defined in a given Phis instance.\nVariables can be selected only one at a time.\nIf the selected variable is associated to no dataset linked to the present experiment, then no graphic is plotted.\nIn the next Phis developments, variables associated a gien project or experimentation will be declared at the level of the project/experimentation.  Date Start . Optionnal. First date from which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a previous date will not appear in the graphic.  Date End . Optionnal. Last date at which variable values are used to produce a graphic.\nVariable values associated to a later date will not appear in the graphic.  The last step is to press the  Search  button, which will lead to the creation of a graphic displaying according to a time axis the variable values associated to:   the scientific objects selected on the map  the variable selected in the  Quantitative Variable  field  potentially the time window between  Date Start  and  Date End  if those fields have been filled out   On the new graphic, the time is displayed on the abscissa axis and the variable on the ordinate axis.\nEach points of the same color are associated to the same scientific object which is identified below the graphic by its URI.\nIn future Phis developments, objects alias instead of URIs will be used as curve labels.\nVariable values and curve associated to an scientific object can be masked by clicking on its associated curve label which at this point changes from black to grey.\nClicking a second time on the label as the effect to show again the previously hidden curve.  Images  Another feature provided by the  Map Visualization  menu is the possibility to show images associated to an experiment, such as hemispherical images shot on the field.  A first step is to select on the map the scientific object (e.g. plot), as explained  above , associated with the images you want to visualize.\nDo not select two scientific objects (or more), otherwise PHIS would look for images associated to both the selected object, while most images are associated to one and only one object.\nAt that point, a new section,  Images Visualization (On selected plot) , appears under the map where the objects have been selected.   The second step is to select the type of image you want to display, selecting it from the list of images type, and then press the  Show Images  button.",

            "text": "What are Phis documents ?  In order to ease the comprehension of projects and experiments, it is possible to upload various documents to Phis and connect them to resources such as infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors or vectors declared in Phis. \nDocuments that could help persons understand a project are typically a (reasearch) contract, a phd (or master) thesis, or various multimedia content such as photos or beamer presentations.\nSimilarly, one could expect knowledge about an experimentation to be provided through documents that could be protocols, experimental designs, technical or scientific files, data files, research papers, etc.\nExamples of document formats are PDF, txt, csv, png images, etc.\nHowever, large files are not yet supported by Phis: a document uploaded to Phis cannot exceed 2MB for now.  The documents uploaded to Phis through the  Documents  section are meant for human consultation.\nHowever, metadata (intelligible to machines) must be provided for every new document.\nThese metadata contain the document properties:   title  creator  language  creation date  document type   Information of a document can later be changed, while the document itself cannot be modified.  Metadata are specified with  Dublin Core  recommendations.\nMetadata enables the documents to be stored in the Phis triplestore.\nThe expression of Dublin Core metadata using the Resource Description Framework is described at  dublincore.org .  Upload a document  Any Phis user can upload a new document and specify its metadata with the  Create Document  button displayed on top of the information sheet of any element prone to be enriched with documents (infrastructures, projects, experiments, sensors and vectors). \nNo admin rights are required from a Phis user to add a new document.  Title . Title of the uploaded document.\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.\nA document title does not have to match the name of the uploaded file it is imported from.  Creator . Name(s) of the document creator(s), separated by commas\nNo specific naming convention is required for filling this field.  Language . Language in which the document is provided.\nIn accordance to the  Dublin Core Element Set v1.1  document, the value of the language element is defined by  RFC 1766  which includes a two-character language code taken from the  ISO639  standard.\nThe language code should be provided in lower case (e.g.  fr  for French,  en  for English, etc.).  Creation Date . Date of the document creation.\nIf unknown, the current date (i.e. the date at the moment of the document upload into Phis) can be used.  Concerned Projects . Project(s) for which the document is relevant.\nOne can select the name of the given project(s) only within the exhaustive list of projects registered to the Phis instance where the new document is uploaded.  Concerned Experimentation . Experiment(s) for which the new document is relevant.\nA Phis user can select the name of the given experiment(s) only within the exhaustive list of experiments it has access to.  Document Type . The nature of the document's content.\nA single type has to be selected from a predefined list.\nOnly one doucment type can be selected.\nPhis controlled vocabulary of document types is defined in Phis ontology.\nIf an element seems to be missing from the proposed predefined list, please contact Phis managers (see  README.md  for Phis managers contact).

Once the file has been uploaded, do not click on the  Upload  button but  Create  underneath, only when all fields have been completed.\nThe upload button is bound to be abandonned in the following Phis development.   Comment . Complete plain text description of the new document, preferably provided in English language.\nFor now, line breaks cannot be inserted in a comment: they could generate a bug.  Click on the  Create  button to complete the document creation, i.e. the document upload and the specification of its metadata with  Dublin Core  standards.  The list of documents a given user has access to is avaible from the navigation bar through the  Tools > Documents  menu.\nFrom  Home / Documents , one can click on the eye icon on the right to see a given document information sheet (metadata).\nFrom there, the document cannot be modified or deleted (in Phis current version).\nHowever, the document metadata can be modified with the  Update  button on top of the information sheet.\nThe document can also be downloaded clicking on the   icon above the  View / Download  text, below the information sheet.",

            "text": "Object types  Plant phenotyping experiments all revolve around one entity of interest: plants !\nHowever, plants can be studied at various scales, from a single leaf to a field.\nPhis experiments register data on elementary units:  scientific objects  (also refered to as agronomical objects), which are no more than declinations of plants, at various scales:   plant organ : part of a given plant (e.g.  rootstock ,  scion ,  silk ,  seed )  plant : single individual, displaying a single genotype (which is refered to as a  variety ). Most common elementary unit of greenhouse experiments.  plot : smallest spatial unit, a.k.a micro-plot (one treatment maximum can be applied on a plot). Most common elementary unit of field experiments.\n<!--  block : combination of plots, generally forming an environmentally homogeneous entity  field : large spatial unit that includes plots and potentially blocks\n-->   These scientific objects, forming the basic units of experimentations, are observed through time, and consequently constitute the origin of phenotypic data.  A given scientific object is required to be associated with one experiment, and one only.\nPhis development team is aware of the challenge in declaring perennial plants studied over several years. One might want to declare it in various experiments, each experiment matching a different time-period.\nPhis development team is open for discussion on this matter with its user.  Phenotypic data created in an experiment, whether it is directly measured, calculated or estimated, is necessarily linked to scientific objects.  Every scientific object is uniquely identified through a standardized URI which is automatically assigned by Phis when it is first entered in the system by a user.\nMetadata is associated to objects under the form of attributes: the object alias, its type (plant, plot, etc.), the experiment it is part of, etc.\nData associated with these objects consists of the values of phenotypic variables (declared in Phis through the  Variables menu ) linked to these objects during the  Data import process .  The complete list of scientific objects declared in Phis is available in the  Scientific Objects  menu, accessible from Phis top navigation bar.\nPhis users with a restricted access (e.g.  guest ) are likely to be unable to see the  Scientific Objects  menu, since there are no objects for them to see.\nThe scientific objects list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter objects by their URI, Alias, type and the experience they are linked to.\nThe scientific objects list also displays additional properties (the objects species, variety, etc.).\nThe list of objects associated with a search result, and their metadata, can be retrieved as a .csv file with the  Download Search Result  button.   Scientific objects information can also be accessed through the  Experiments  menu.\nAfter having selected an experiment, the scientific objects linked to it can be displayed on a map.\nMoreover, selecting objects on such a map provides additional information on the attributes of these objects.\nSee the  Map Visualization  section for more information on that matter.  Importing scientific objects  Within the  Scientific Objects  menu, Phis users can import new plots with the Create  button.  Scientific objects such as plots are imported into Phis through an editable table in which each row contains the information of an additionnal scientifc object to be inserted in Phis database.  One can also copy and paste in this table the content of a .csv file whose header is:  Alias;Type;Experiment;Geometry;Parent;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Replication  Description of the content of this table, column by column:  Generated URI . Field to leave blank. Every new scientific object will be automatically assigned an URI when declared in Phis.  Alias . Internal name of the scientific object (free text).\nIn a given experiment, there can not be two identical aliases.  Type . Type of the scientific object, chosen from a closed list containing:   Plot  Plant  Leaf  Rootstock  Seed  Scion  Silk  ScientificObject (generic term, it is not recommended to use it)   There is only a handful of proposed scientific object types in the current ontology: do not hesitate to contact OpenSILEX development team to add object types that cannot be found in the list in order to make it evolve.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.  Experiment . URI of the experiment the declared scientific objects belong to.\nIf this field is not filled excusively with URIs of experiments stored in Phis, then no scientific object will be added to the system.\nThe experiments URIs can be selected from a dropdown list displaying all experiments declared in the system.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.\nNote that as described in the  Modifying scientific objects  section, it is possible to link a scientific object to several experiments in two steps. From the  Scientific Objects  menu :   Using the  Create  button, create scientific objects with a given experiment URI in the  Experiment  column  Using the  Update  button, copy and paste the table used in the scientific object creation, and then replace the value of the  Experiment  column with another experiment URI  Repeat the step 2 everytime you want to associate the same scientific objects to another experiment   Geometry . Optionnal. Vector geometry such as polygons (for plots), provided according to  Well-known text standard ).\nGeometry coordinates are formatted in  WGS84 , also known as the  EPSG4326  geodetic coordinate system.\nMore information on this system  here .\nA quick way to draw WKT polygons from a map is to use the \"draw a shape\" tool of the  sandbox  website.\nHowever, it is recommended to use professional geographic information systems such as  QGis .  Parent . Optionnal. URI of the parent scientific object, for example the URI of a previously declared plot when declaring in the system a plant that has been harvested from this plot.\nAnother example is a plant URI which can be used as a parent of a plant organ being declared.  Species . Optionnal. The URI of the species of a plant, a plant part or plot (free text).\nThe Species URIs can be selected from a dropdown list displaying all species URIs declared in the system.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list: the column width will then expand automatically.\nThe complete list of species found in Phis is displayed in the   Experimental organization / Species  menu, described in the  Species  section of this documentation.  Variety . Optionnal. The variety of a plant or a plant part or the variety of a plot (free text).  Additional scienfic object properties that can be declared through the web services but not through the web client:  ExperimentModalities . The experiment modality of the plot, no controlled vocabulary required so far (e.g. \"WD\" for water deficit). (free text).  Replication . The repetition of the scientific object mostly used for plots (e.g. 1, 2, A, or B...). (free text).  Insertion status . Automatically filled when clicking on the  Create Scientific Objects  button : this indicator shows which new scientific objects have been created and which one have failed to be added to the system.  Every other additional line matches with a new scientific object.  Let's take into consideration a fictionnal experiment composed of 4 plots of the same crop (\"Species\").\nIn half of the plot, the variety \"A\" of the studied crop is grown, and in the other half, the variety \"B\".\nOf two plots dispaying the same variety, one is submitted to an experiment modality labelled \"treatment 1\", while the other is submitted to a \"treatment 2\".\nExperiments and Species have to be expressed with their internal Phis URI.\nThis configuration is sum up in the following table:     Alias  Geometry  ExperimentURI  Species  Variety  ExperimentModalities  Replication      plot1  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyA  Treatment1  Rep1    plot2  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyA  Treatment2  Rep1    plot3  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyB  Treatment1  Rep1    plot4  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  URI Experiment X  URI Species Y  varietyB  Treatment2  Rep1     The file necessary to import those four plots is a 5 line csv file: after the header, every line of the imported file needs to display the 7 required elements, for instance separated by semicolons (or commas):  Alias;Geometry;ExperimentURI;Species;Variety;ExperimentModalities;Replication\nplot1;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot2;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyA;Treatment2;Rep1\nplot3;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment1;Rep1\nplot4;POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ));URI Experiment X;URI Species Y; varietyB;Treatment2;Rep1  Such a file can be then copied and pasted to the handsontable form.  A single scientific object cannot correspond to several species, variety, experimental modality or replication.\nOn the contrary, the same species, variety, experimental modality or replication can be used for several scientific objects.  Some scientific object type such as plots can be described by geometrical objects such as polygons, whose GPS coordinates are provided following the  Well-known text standard ).  The first step in order to import scientific object is usually to create a .csv file containing all the new plots information, as is reminded below:     Alias  Geometry  ExperimentURI  Species  Variety  ExperimentModalities  Replication      expX_modY_plotZ  POLYGON (( ... ... , ... ... ))  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/.../...  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/id/species/...  e.g. varietyX  e.g. nitrogen-1  e.g. 1 (or A-I)     The second step is to copy and paste the content of the CSV file in the handsontable form displayed in the  Home / Scientific Objects / Create Scientific Object  menu and then click on the  Create Scientific Objects  bottom button to complete the declaration of scientific objects.    Modifying scientific objects  Within the  Scientific Objects  menu, Phis users can modify the properties of existing scientific objects with the  Update  button.  Scientific objects such as plots are modified through an editable table in which each row contains the information of an additionnal scientifc object to be modified in Phis database.  Even if you want to change the value of only one property of an experimental object (i.e. its experimental modality), you need to provide in the handsontable all of its former properties that you want to keep (e.g. type, species, etc.), otherwise this information will be lost.  It is not possible to change the experiment to which a scientific object participates, however it is possible to state that a scientific object participates in various experiments.\nIn order to assign scientific objects to two experiments, one has to create those scientific objects through the  Create  button of the  Home / Scientific Objects  menu, assigning them to a first experiment, and then submit the same table through the  Update  button, with the exception of the \"ExperimentURI\" field which will display of URI of the other experiment the new scientific objects belong to.

Every variable produced by an experiment must have been previously created in Phis, and every variable created in Phis has to be defined unambuigusously.\nConsequently, when a user refers to a variable in an experiment, there is no ambiguity about the concept he is refering to.\nMoreover, the usage of unequivocal variables in experiments is a necessary step towards a more intelligible, reliable and reproducible Science.  Phis variables are listed in the  Variables  menu.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g.  guestphis ) is likely to be unable to see the  Variables  menu, since there is no variable for her/him to see.  Variable definition is based on the  Crop Ontology guidelines (draft document) .\nTherefore, Phis variables are all unequivocally characterized by the following triplet:   a single  trait , either a phenotypic trait or an environmental feature, which is the subject of the new variable  a single  method  of measurement or computation of the trait  a single  unit  in which is expressed the value of the trait   Further information on a given variable is available on its information sheet, accessed to from the variables list through the eye-icon on the right-hand side of this project row.   A variable information sheet provides knowledge on this variable, but also on the three elements that define it, namely the  trait ,  method  and  unit  related to this variable.\nThe variable and those three defining features all display a  label , that should be meaningful and unique, but does not have to be so, an  URI  which is however unique, a  Definition  (or  Comment ) meant for human comprehension, and  related references  meant for Semantic Web applications.\nReference to external ontologies is achieved through  SKOS  standards  NB: for now, only phenotypic variables are present  Create variables, traits, methods and units  Every variable found on Phis has been previously created by a Phis user.\nWithin the  Variables  menu, one can create a new project with the Create Variable  button.  Variable label . This field is automatically produced with the concatenation of the trait, method and unit labels, separated by underscores.\nThe resulting variable label is not necessarily unique, but it would be better if it was.\nOn the contrary, the automatically generated URI (not shown in the  Create Variable  menu) is unique.  Trait . If the trait associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the  Trait label  field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the  +  green icon on the right-hand side of the  Trait label  field.   In the case of a new trait, do not fill the  Trait label  field but the  Internal label  one, below the  -  red icon that replaced the  +  green icon.\nThis new trait label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other trait labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided since trait, method and unit labels are concatenated to generate the new variable name with the format  Trait_Method_Unit .  A  Comment  should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the trait specifics as clearly as possible.   Method . If the method associated to the new variable has already been created in Phis, one can select it through the predefined list of the  Method label  field.\nOtherwise, it has to be created, which can be achieved by clicking on the  +  green icon on the right-hand side of the  Method label  field.   In the case of a new method, do not fill the  Method label  field but the  Internal label  one, below the  -  red icon that replaced the  +  green icon.\nThis new method label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other method labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.  A  Comment  should be added, preferably in English, in order to explicit the method specifics as clearly as possible.  Unit . If the unit associated to the new variable cannot be found on the  Unit label  predefined list, a new unit has to be created.\nThis can be achieved by clicking on the  +  green icon on the right-hand side of the  Unit label  field.\nIn the case of a new unit, do not fill the  Unit label  field but the  Internal label  one, below the  -  red icon that replaced the  +  green icon.\nThis new unit label should be if possible meaningful, distinct from other unit labels, and underscores \"_\" should be avoided.  Otherwise, if the appropriate unit is already register in Phis, then one only has to select it from the  Unit label  field, without clicking on the  +  green icon (or clicking on the  -  red icon if the  +  green icon had previously been clicked on).  In the tricky case of a variable presenting no unit (e.g. pH), it is advised to crete a new unit whose label would be: dimensionless_unit_ variable-name  (e.g. dimensionless_unit_pH).\nIt matters in order not to use the same \"unit\" for every variable displaying a dimensionless unit.\nMore on this topic on the  ontobee.org  website.   Related References .\nIn order to unambiguously define the new variable, semantic relations are established by the user between the new variable and concepts already defined in reliable ontologies existing on the world wide web.\nThese relations to external ontologies are established using  SKOS  (Simple Knowledge Organization System).  Entity  refers to the Phis entity that will be associated to a concept found in an ontology.\nThis  Entity  be either the new variable, trait, method or unit.\nIt is not required to specify related concepts for traits, methods and units, however it is recommanded.  Relation  refers to the nature of the relation between the entity and the concept defined in an ontology.\nThis semantic relation is provided using SKOS.\nThe entity can either be, compared to an ontology concept, an  exact match , a  close match ,  narrower  or  broader .  SKOS mapping properties,  skos:closeMatch  and  skos:exactMatch , are used to state alignement links between SKOS concepts, as indicated in the  w3 SKOS Mapping properties web page :   exactMatch : used to link two concepts, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval applications.  skos:exactMatch  is a transitive property, and is a sub-property of  skos:closeMatch .  Example:  <MyNewNDVIVariable> skos:exactMatch <CO_322:0000880>  asserts that the variable 'MyNewNDVIVariable' created in Phis refers to the exact same concept as does the variable 'NDVI_M_idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000880'  closeMatch : used to link two concepts that are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. In order to avoid the possibility of \"compound errors\" when combining mappings across more than two concept schemes,  skos:closeMatch  is not declared to be a transitive property.  Example:  <MyNewLAIVariable> skos:closeMatch <http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_321:0001254>  asserts that the variable 'MyNewLAIVariable' created in Phis is very similar to the variable 'LAI_Calc_Idx' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_321:0001254'   SKOS hierarchical properties  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are used to assert a direct hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts, as indicated in the  w3 Semantic Relations web page :   broader  (label= has broader ): a triple  <A> skos:broader <B>  asserts that  <B> , the object of the triple, is a broader concept than  <A> , the subject of the triple.  Example:  <MyNewPlantHeightTrait> skos:broader <CO_322:0000994>  asserts that the trait 'MyNewPlantHeightTrait' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a broader one: which is the concept refered to by the trait 'Plant height' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'CO_322:0000994'  narrower  (label= has narrower ):  a triple  <C> skos:narrower <D>  asserts that  <D> , the object of the triple, is a narrower concept than  <C> , the subject of the triple.  skos:broader  is  owl:inverseOf  the property  skos:narrower .   Example:  <MyNewStageEstimationMethod> skos:narrower <http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/>  asserts that the method 'MyNewStageEstimationMethod' created in Phis refers to a concept that has a narrower one, which is the concept refered to by the method 'Silking date - Estimation' already defined in the Crop Ontology and uniquely identified as 'http://www.cropontology.org/terms/CO_322:0000905/'   By convention,  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are only used to assert a direct (i.e., immediate) hierarchical link between two SKOS concepts. This provides applications with a convenient and reliable way to access the direct broader and narrower links for any given concept. Note that, to support this usage convention, the properties  skos:broader  and  skos:narrower  are not declared as transitive properties.  Reference URI  refers to the URI of the concept found on ontologies such as the ones suggested in the short list above the  Related References  field.\nThe URI provided here is not necessarily the URL of the web page of the ontology on which the targeted concept is defined.\nIndeed, the URI of a given concept does not necessarily match with the URL of the web page where this concept has been found.

Example: http://www.cropontology.org/rdf/CO_322:0000907 is the hyperlink (URL) associated to the URI of the concept \"Silk_Date_ymd\" of the Crop Ontology.\nIn this example, the URI of the concept is also an URL (a hyperlink), but it is not the case for every ontology.  When a variable is created, multiple references using SKOS can be stated, using the  +  white icon.   Which portals provide a link towards various ontologies ?  The  AgroPortal  project aims to offer a reference ontology repository for agronomy, reusing the NCBO BioPortal technology, as stated on the  FAO website .\nThe scientific outcomes and the experience of the biomdical domain are thus exploited and transposed into the agronomy domain, including plants, food, environment and possibly animal sciences.  The  Ephesis Ontotology Portal   is a JavaScript widget displaying all the observation variables of a Breeding API endpoint.\nIt lists ontologies available with the BreedingAPI/CropOntology JSON format.  Here are some examples of ontologies:  The  Crop Ontology (CO)  current objective is to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of crops, on trait mesurement and methods, as well as on germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms.  The  Plant Ontology (PO)  is a structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology, growth and development to plant genomics data.\nThe URL provided  here  redirects visitors to the Planteome website since PO is developed by the Planteome Project, alongside with other reference ontologies listed in the  Planteome Ontologies webpage .\nThe  Planteome  project is a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to access plant genomics data.  The  Unit Ontology  gathers metrical units for use in conjunction with  PATO  (Phenotype And Trait Ontology), which is a phenotypic quality ontology.  Which other ressources, besides ontologies, can I link my variables to ?  AGROVOC  is a controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, etc.\nIt is published by the FAO and edited by a community of experts.\nMore information is provided on the  FAO website .  Variable Definition . Text defining clearly the concept underlying the new variable.\nThis definition should ideally be provided in English.

            "text": "Dataset properties  The heart of experiments is to produce datasets associated with the agronomical variables it studies.\nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping platforms commonly set up experiments in which plant growth is monitored.\nPlant growth dynamics are analyzed through the evolution of various variable (e.g. LAI, NDVI, etc.) through time.  At this stage of development, all dataset variables are quantitative.\nNo qualitative variables are saved in the datasets: a variable from a dataset can only assume numerical values and no character string is allowed.  A dataset typically displays information on many scientific objects.\nThese objects can be described by several variables.\nEach one of these variables can assume diverse values at different dates.\nIn order to avoid confusion, each element of a dataset should then be understood as a triplet object-time-variable.\nThus, each element of a dataset is associated uniquely with   a single scientific object (e.g. a plot)  a single date (the day of the data acquisition)  a single variable (a quantitative variable used to monitor the measured or calculated trait)  a single variable numerical value (the value of the variable cited above)   Datasets are available indirectly through the  Experiments  menu, selecting an experiment and then accessing to its map through the  Map Visualization  button.  Graphics can be extracted from the experiment datasets in the  Dataset(s) Visualization (On selected plot(s))  section, which appears under the map of the experiment when scientific objects are selected.\nHow to create such graphics is explained in the  Map Visualization  section of this documentation.  Import Dataset  Datasets can be added to Phis through the  Dataset  menu in the top navigation bar.\nA Phis user with a restricted access (e.g.  guestphis ) is likely to be unable to see the  Dataset  menu.\nIndeed, only users that are part of an owner group are authorized to add datasets to the experiments associated to this group.\nGo to the  Groups level of access  section for further information on this issue.  When adding a dataset to Phis, three types of elements can be created:   the dataset itself, as a .csv file  the metadata associated to this dataset (e.g. variables in the dataset, creation date, etc.)  optionnal documents associated to the dataset   Quantitative Variable . Mandatory field. Variable or list of the variables found in the added dataset.\nThe variable(s) must have previously been defined in Phis (see  Variables ).  Dataset Creation Date . Mandatory field. Date in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format matching to the day in which the imported data has been generated.\nLet's take the example of a drone flight performed two weeks before the data import, followed by the production of clean data from the flight images one week before the import.\nThe imported data is the clean data created one week before the data import.\nTherefore, the date to provide in  Dataset Creation Date  is the one corresponding to one week before the data import.\nThis field is necessary for provenance purposes.  Was generated By .\nOptionnal document giving indications on how the data has been created.\nIf a single script (e.g. in R or python language) has been used to create the imported data, it should be uploaded here.\nIf the data creation process has been more complex, a document (e.g. PDF or text) could be provided to describe it.\nThe document import is performed via the  Add Document Script  button.\nThe metadata to provide is the same as in any Phis document, see the  Upload a document  section.\nOnly one document can be added to this field.\nMore documents can be imported together with the dataset through the  Linked Document(s)  field.   Description .  Informative plain text description of how the imported data has been generated, preferably provided in English language.\nFor instance, if the data has been generated with Phenoscript v1.2, one can mention it here, especially if the concerned script cannot be imported.

Data File . This mandatory field is used by users to upload the dataset from their computer through the  Browse  button.   The dataset added to Phis must respect some file rules:   the file must be a .csv file  the first line of the file is a header, every other additional row matches with a new element characterized by a single scientific object, a single date and as many variable values as there are variables  in a given row, each items are separated by a single semicolon  ;  the header contains the fields  ScientificObjectURI  and  Date , and as many variable alias as there are added variables (see the .csv template that can be downloaded above the  Data File  field)  the scientific objects are refered to by their respective URI  the date is refered to in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-date) format  variable values are provided as real number, since Phis then stores numbers as  double-precision floating-point value  numerical values decimal separators should be dots  .  but commas  ,  are tolerated  no character strings, \"NA\" included, are tolerated as variable values: if a variable value is unknown, do not write anything (see example below)  no quotes for URIs, dates or variable values   In the following example, the added dataset exhibits information on two objects, one of them (URI1) displaying values for one variable at three different dates, and the other one (URI2) displaying values for two variables at the same dates:  ScientificObjectURI;Date;VariableAlias1;VariableAlias2\nURI1;2017-04-01;;5\nURI1;2017-04-15;;10.0\nURI1;2017-04-31;;12.00\nURI2;2017-04-01;3.22;6\nURI2;2017-04-15;4.12;9\nURI2;2017-04-31;5.347687869;10  The URI of the scientific objects of a given experimentation can be found on the  Scientific objects  menu, using search filters, and then downloaded with the  Download Search Result  button (see the  Object types  of this documentation).\nAll variables values of the imported dataset are associated with scientific objects that must have been previously declared in Phis (see  Importing Scientific Objects ).  The data file imported in Phis can displays many fields (i.e. number of items in the header), but only the column matching with the expected fields will be kept.\nThe expected fields and their name are provided in the .csv template provide by the  Download Template  link above the  Data File  field.\nHence, users can copy and paste their data in the template file (keeping the header unchanged), or import directly their datasheet as a .csv, after having renamed correctly the fields as described in the template.   In order to finalize the addition of the dataset, click on the bottom  Create  button.   The waiting time following the use of the  Create  button can relatively long, depending on the quantity of variable values added.\nIf an error occurs, the dataset is not added to Phis and an error message is displayed.   Else, the dataset is imported in Phis and a success message is displayed.   At the current stage of Phis development, datasets cannot be modified nor deleted once it has been added to Phis.

            "text": "What are events ?  Events are crucial pieces of information used to enrich Phis datasets.\nEvents are ponctual occurrences happening during an experiment, and potentially having an impact on the recorded data.\nThose events can be either planned (e.g. a sowing date) or unexpected (e.g. damages to a field experiment caused by wild animals).  Events, like simple annotations, are created following the  Open Annotation Data Model  that allows assigning motivation and purpose attributes to annotations (e.g. oa:describing, oa:identifying, oa:linking, oa: replying, etc.).  Dublin Core  and  foaf  specifications such as  dcterms:created ,  dcterms:creator ,  foaf:Agent  are also used.  Ontology of Experimental Events  An application ontology developped at INRA Montpellier, compliant with the standards of OWL, provides the structured vocabulary necessary to describe all events created and then stored in Phis: it is the Ontology of Experimental Events (OEEv), hosted by  AgroPortal .\nIt can be accessed to from  agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/OEEV .  The  Ontology of Experimental Events , characterises events that occur during an experiment, e.g. dates of sowing, application of a given treatment, harvesting, measurements or sampling for -omic measurements, or any category of technical problem. The OEEv ontology contains four groups of events, namely  Facility Management ,  Scientific Object Management ,  Trouble  and  Displacement .  Facility Management  The  Facility Management  refers to the set of actions related to the management and maintenance infrastructure and supporting equipment. It describes events related to  servicing ,  maintenance  and  calibration of equipment or installations .  Scientific Object Management  The  Scientific Object Management  contains different sub-categories of events related to the typical operations conducted on plants or plots in experiments:   AddingProduct  refers to the application of products such as fertilizers  Clipping  is related to the installation of accessories surch as embeded sensors  Detasseling  refres to removal of the tassel of maize  Harvesting  refers to the harvest of the plant  Irrigation  describes irrgation events  Thinning  refers to the removal of some plants, or parts of plants, to make room for the growth of others  Treatment  related to either curative or preventive treatments applied to plants  PhenolgyScoring  refers to the set of events related to the different phenological stages of plants.  Potting  applies to pot experiments  Sowing  applies for both field and pot experiments  Stacking  refers to the action of putting plant tutors   Trouble  The event  Trouble  is defined by three different sub-categories:   Breakdown  (sensor or conveyor)  Dysfunction  (sensor fault, irrigation trouble)  Incident  (a pot falls down, a leaf is blocked in an imaging cabin, lodging of a plot, human error, etc.)   Several subtypes of  incidents  that often occur in platfortm or field experiments have been declared including:   PotFall  Lodging  StuckPlant  PestAttack   Displacement (object tracking)  The  Displacement  event has been created to follow the position in time and space of the different objects participating in experiments. For instance, plants are often transferred, during a single indoor experiment, between installations or compartments with different environmental conditions. Similarly, sensors can be replaced or moved to different positions in the field or greenhouse. The  MoveTo  and  MoveFrom  concepts allow tracking objects.",

formally declared by a Phis user.\n\n\nThe link sensor-variable for phenotypic sensors such as cameras is not available, since most of those sensors do not provide directly intelligible data, but intermediate outputs such as images or other complex information which have to be treated before providing practical phenotypic variables such as plant heigh or chlorophyll content.\n\n\nCreation of a

One selects the sensor that need to be characterized providing two pieces of information :   Type  URI (will be changed to Alias in a future version of Phis)   Cameras  Camera characteristics common to all cameras are :  Height (pixels) . Number of rows of pixels for the images.  Width (pixels) . Number of pixels in each row for the images.  Pixel Size (\u00b5m) . Pixel size for the images in \u00b5m.

Link sensors to environmental variables  Purpose of the sensor-variable link  The link between a sensor and the data it produces can be established through Phis web client.\nThis link enables the visualization through graphics of the raw data produced by an environmental sensor directly from its information sheet.  This feature is for now dedicated only to environmental sensors measuring variations in the plant environment (e.g. humidity, temperature, radiation sensors...).\nThe output these sensors are environmental variables whose values can be displayed on the sensor information sheet they are linked to, if this link has been formally declared by a Phis user.  The link sensor-variable for phenotypic sensors such as cameras is not available, since most of those sensors do not provide directly intelligible data, but intermediate outputs such as images or other complex information which have to be treated before providing practical phenotypic variables such as plant heigh or chlorophyll content.  Creation of a the sensor-variable link  From the information sheet of an environmental sensor, one can associate it with variables already declared in the system through to the  Variables  menu.  A single environmental sensor can be linked to several variables previously declared in Phis.  From the  Sensors  menu (accessible from the  installation  menu in the top navigation bar), select a sensor from the sensors list clicking on the eye icon on the right to access its information sheet.\nThen, go to the  Variables  field and add variables from the dropdown list displaying all the alias of the variables previously declared in Phis.   After having selected one or several variables, click on the  Update measured variable  button (check symbol) on the right to save the changes you made to the sensor.\nYou should get a green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the  Update measured variable  button.  The sensor-variable link is now saved in the triplestore and displayed in the  Variables  field of the sensor information sheet.\nTo remove this link, just click on the close window symbol (\"x\") next to the variable alias in the  Variables  field of the sensor, and then click on the  Update measured variable  button.\nYou should get another green \"Resources updated\" pop-up on the top right corner of your screen after having clicked on the  Update measured variable  button, which confirms the changes made.   If Phis contains data associated to the variables now linked to a given sensor, this data can be visualized from this sensor information sheet.\nA graphic displaying the last recorded values of the variable (e.g. the last outputs from the sensor) is automatically produced in the  Sensor Data Visualization  section of the sensor information sheet.   One can scroll through the data linked to a sensor using the  Date Start  and  Date End  values of the filter displayed on top of the graphic, and then clicking on the  Search  button.",

            "text": "Actuators properties  In order to characterize as precisely as possible the plants environment, users can also declare in the  Actuators  menu the name and attributes of the tools used to modify the water content, light, humidity, etc.  Similarly to sensors, some actuators can also produce raw data. For instance, the volume of water provided by an irrigation system is an environmental data that can be stored in Phis, but only if it is linked to the actuators involved in said watering.  The  Actuators  menu displays the list of individual actuators that have been declared by the user on Phis.\nThe actuator list is preceded by a research bar enabling the user to filter registered actuators by their URI, Alias, type, brand and optionnal attributes, such as their model or their serial number.   From  Home / Actuators , one can click on the eye icon on the right of any listed actuator to see its information sheet.   At the top of the actuator information sheet lies the  Add document  button which remains orange until a first document has been added.\nDocuments linked to a actuator are typicaly a technical notice or a user manual.\nSee the  Documents  section for further information on documents and how to insert them in Phis.\nThe  Add annotation  button can be used by any user in order to annotate the selected actuator using the  Web Annotation Data Model  (oa).\nSee the  Annotation  section for further information on annotations within Phis.\nThe  Add event  button can be used by any user in order to link an event to the selected actuator.\nSee the  Events  section for further information on events within Phis.  Add actuators  Adding multiple actuators can be achieved by selecting the  Create Actuator  button at the top-left side of the  Actuators  menu.  The  Add Actuators  menu consists of an editable table in which each additionnal row should contain the information of an additionnal individual actuator to be entrered in Phis database.\nThe user interface has been built using Handsontable, a JavaScript spreadsheet that allow the user (i) to check quickly the data he is creating and (ii) to copy and paste entire tables into the  Add Actuators  menu.  The mandatory fields, in red, are:   Alias  Type  Brand  Person In Charge   However, it is highly recommended to fill every field, except the  Generated URI  field which is automatically produced by Phis after the user clicks on  Create Actuators .  Alias . Internal name of the actuator (free text).  Type . Type of the actuator, chosen from a closed list.\nProposed actuator types are mainly greenhouse actuators : do not hesitate to contact OpenSILEX development team to add actuator types that cannot be found in the list in order to make it evolve.\nIf the dropdown list isn't displayed correctly, try selecting any element of the list : the column width will then expand automatically.   Brand . Brand of the actuator (free text).\n\"homemade\" is a valid answer for actuators engineered/modified on site.  Serial Number . Free-text used to store the actuator serial number. Optionnal.  Model . Model of the actuator (free text).  Date of Purchase . Date of the purchase (or creation for homemade actuators) of the actuator, provided in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format. Optionnal.  In Service Date . Date provided in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format of the first use of the actuator. Optionnal.  Date of Last Calibration . Date provided in the YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) format of the last calibration of the actuator. Optionnal.  Person In Charge . Username (email adress) of the person in charge of the sensing device (typically, the manager of the installation).\nIf the person in charge is not displayed in the dropdown list, you should first add it to the list of persons through the  Tools > Persons  menu. See the  Create a Person  section for details.  Not correctly filled fields appear in red.\nAs long as cells are displayed in red, no actuator can be created.   Note that when you add a single actuator only, you need to remove the second row displayed by default, using the  Remove row  button which appears after a right-click anywhere on the row to delete.\nThe number of rows has to match the number of added actuators.   The  delete actuator  function has not been implemented yet : contact the OpenSILEX development team in order to ask for a actuator to be removed.",

Modification of the CSV  The first row of the CSV file displays its header:     path_image_ref  imageType  concernedItemUri  concernedItemType  position  date  sensorUri      Then, each row of this CSV file is associated to an image imported in OpenSILEX PHIS.\nEach image is characterized by:   path_Image_ref : the name and path of the image (e.g.  image001.png )  ImageType : the URI associated with the type of the image (e.g.  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/vocabulary/2017#HemisphericalImage  or  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/vocabulary/2017#RGBImage )  concernedItemUri : the URI of the entity associated to the image, typically an agronomical object such a plot (e.g.  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/mtp/2017/o1000001 )  concernedItemType : the URI associated with the type of the entity associated with the image (e.g.  http://www.phenome-fppn.fr/vocabulary/2017#Plot )  position  (optionnal): if a sensor can display several positions, then you might want to fill the position from which the image has been shot (e.g.  1 )  date : date at which the image has been shot, using the  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  format (e.g.  2017-06-15 09:00:00 )  sensorUri : URI of the sensor who captured the image (the URI of the sensors you registered in OpenSILEX PHIS are available on the  Sensors menu )   All of these information are filled in plain text and without brackets.  Both image types and entity types have to be submitted using the controlled vocabulary linked to OpenSILEX PHIS application ontology.\nThe list of images types can be found in the  Tools / Vocabulary  menu of OpenSILEX PHIS webapp.  Execution of the Python script  Like any other Python3 script, e.g. using ipython or a linux terminal as follows:  python3 post.py",
